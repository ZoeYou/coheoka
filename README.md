## Install

You must run a CoreNLP server on your own if you want to run any module in this repository.

You can download Stanford CoreNLP at [here](http://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/download.html) and run a local server by this way:
```
java -mx4g -cp "*" edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.StanfordCoreNLPServer
```

Then you can find a demo at [`localhost:9000`](http://localhost:9000/), which visualizes StanfordCoreNLP's complicated annotation for English documents.

You can also find an online demo maintained by Stanford at [here](http://corenlp.run/).
