Rickets is a disease in young children. It is caused by lack of vitamin D and calcium. Rickets causes bigger gaps inside bones and turns them dry and spongy, it also makes a curve on the legs.Vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin that is found in food and can also be made in your body after exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun. Sunshine is a significant source of vitamin D because UV rays from sunlight trigger vitamin D synthesis in the skin by mehran
The word "rickets" comes from the Greek word "rhakhis," which means "spine".

The former subdivisions of Pakistan are states, provinces and territories of Pakistan. Most of which existed between 1947 and 1975.

Pakistan's subdivisions originate from those of British India, during their rule the British had established provinces and chief commissioners. After 1947 Pakistan and India became independent when British India was divided.
From 1947 to 1971, Pakistan was split into two areas (East and West Pakistan) that were 1600 kilometres apart separated by India in the middle. The eastern wing had one province - East Bengal which included the Sylhet District from the former Indian province of Assam. The western wing was formed from three Governor's provinces (North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), West Punjab and Sind), one Chief Commissioner's Province (Baluchistan), several princely states and parts of Kashmir.

Tintagel Castle is in Cornwall, a county in England.
Reginald, Earl of Cornwall built the castle on Tintagel Head (a piece of land by the sea) in about 1150. In Cornish legend, this is the place where the old Kings of Cornwall lived. Reginald built the castle for propaganda, not for military use; he wanted people to think of Camelot when they thought about him. Some people say King Arthur was born at the castle, because traditional stories say the King of Cornwall looked after him when he was a child.
The modern village of Tintagel was first called Trevena. Then, in the 1850s, it got a new name, to bring in tourism because of the King Arthur and Camelot legends. Really, Tintagel is only the name of land by the sea.

Ketamine is an anesthetic. It causes a so called dissociative analgesia, which means that it has a high analgesic effect but a minor hypnotic, so treated people can be nearly awake but without feeling pain. Sometimes it can lead to hallucinations. That is why some people use it as a recreational drug. As it can have severe side effects, it is usually not available as an over-the-counter drug. For many years Ketamine had been available just as an racemic mixture (S and R-Ketamine in equal molarities). The new Enantiomer Esketamin has much fewer of these side effects.
A prescription is needed to get it (too).

The Sea of Japan (also called East Sea) is a sea in the western Pacific Ocean. It is between Korea to the west, Russia to the north and Japan to the east and south. There is a conflict in naming the sea. South Korea claim that it is East Sea, and North Korea claim that it is East Korea Sea.

International Hydrographic Organization(IHO) decided to call this sea area "Sea of Japan" in 1929.
Since 1992, South Korea requests the world to use the names "East Sea" or "Sea of Korea" instead of "Sea of Japan".
South Korea argues that this sea area has been called "East Sea" since early times. It is also a common belief that the name "East Sea" was eliminated from the maps of the world in the early 20th century while South Korea was under the rule of Japan.
On the contrary, Japan insists that the name "Sea of Japan" has been used more widely than "East Sea" in Europe and America since the 18th century.

Obesity is the condition of being much too heavy for ones height. In other words, it means to be highly "overweight". People are called obese when the weight is a threat to their health.
To know if a person is overweight, the body mass index (BMI) is calculated, by dividing the weight (in kilograms) by the height of the person in meters, squared (multiplied by itself). (This is only meaningful for adults who are fully grown, and should not be used for children.)
A BMI between 20 and 25 is considered "normal". People with a BMI of 25 or more are said to be overweight; with 30 and above, they are considered obese, and with 35 and above, they are considered "severely obese" (this used to be called "morbidly obese").
Someone who is 1.75m tall, and has a weight of 80kg, would have a BMI of formula_1. This gives a BMI of 26.12(..) - He or she would therefore be considered overweight.
Obesity is usually helped by diet (being careful about what food to eat) and exercise.Some people also use weight loss programs. In severe cases, drugs can be given. In very severe cases, weight-loss surgery can be done.
Obesity can occur for many reasons, the main two are over-eating and genetic inheritance (where the disease is passed on from parent to child and treatment is not available).

A sin is something that a religion tells its believers is a bad thing to do.
Religions that believe in God usually say that God told them that some things are sins. Usually the sacred books of a religion talk about sins. There are some things that most religions agree are sins. For example, almost every religion agrees that it is wrong to kill people (murder).
There are other things that are sins in only a few religions. For example, Muslims and Jews say that it is wrong to eat pork, but other religions do not think that it's wrong to eat this.
Some people are not religious. They say that people should try to do the things that help other people, and not to do the things that hurt other people. People who are not religious do not usually say that the things that hurt other people are "sins", but sometimes they use this word for these things.
Most religions describe "sins" as actions that break their rules.

A permanent wave, commonly called a perm, is the chemical treatment of hair to produce curls.
The first chemical treatment for curling hair that was suitable for use on people was invented in the year 1906 by the German hairdresser Karl Nessler (1872-1951). He used a mixture of cow urine and water. The first public demonstration took place on October 8, 1906, but Nessler had been working on the idea since 1896. Previously, wigs had been set with caustic chemicals to form curls, but these recipes were too harsh to use on human skin.

Neo-Nazism means the ideology of some political groups who want to return to the beliefs and practices of Nazism after the end of World War II. Different groups have their own sets of beliefs and practices. These often include: loyalty to Adolf Hitler, hating Jews (anti-Semitism), racism, xenophobia (hating and fearing foreigners), extremist nationalism, white supremacy, militarism, and hatred of homosexuals (homophobia). Neo-Nazis often use the symbols of Nazi Germany such as the Swastika.

A stock exchange, share market or bourse is a place where people meet to buy and sell shares of company stock. Some stock exchanges are real places (like the New York Stock Exchange), others are virtual places (like the NASDAQ).

On October 29, 1929, the stock market crashed on what is known as Black Tuesday. A "crash" means that the prices of stock were lowered greatly, and no one wanted to buy it. Instead, they sold the stock for cheap prices. Also, banks were trying to buy stock with people's money (stored inside the bank), so the banks ran out of money too. That way, only a few people could afford the cost of living. This was the start of the Great Depression.

Wired Equivalent Privacy (also known as WEP) is a standard to use encryption in Wireless LANs. It was intorduced in 1999.
In 2001, mathematicians showed that WEP is not very strong. A WEP connection could be decoded, with software that can be easily found, within minutes. Because of this finding, IEEE created a new 802.11i group to fix the problems. By 2003, the Wi-Fi Alliance announced that Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) would replace WEP, which was a subset of then upcoming 802.11i amendment. Finally in 2004, they made it official and said htat it would go ahead. It was part of the full 802.11i standard (also known as WPA2), the IEEE declared that both WEP-40 and WEP-104 "have been deprecated as they fail to meet their security goals".
Even though it only offers low security, WEP is still widely in use. WEP is often the first security choice presented to users by router configuration tools even. Today, WEP provides a level of security that deters only accidental use. As a result, people can invade and enter the network.
People sometimes call it "Wireless Encryption Protocol", which is wrong.

A device controller is a part of a computer system that makes sense of the signals going to, and coming from the CPU processor. There are many device controllers in a computer system. Any device connected to the computer is connected by a plug and socket, and the socket is connected to a device controller. Device controllers use binary and digital codes.
Each device controller has a local buffer and a command register.It communicates with the cpu by INTERRUPTS.
Device Controller play an important role in order to operate that device.Its just like a bridge between deivce and operating system.

An Uzi is a type of submachine gun. There are many different kinds of Uzis: Mini Uzi, which is a smaller version of the Uzi, Micro Uzi; which is only slightly larger than a standard pistol, Para Micro Uzi; which was made for counter terrorist units, and the Uzi Pistol; which is the semi-automatic (meaning it fires 1 bullet every time you pull the trigger). All of these kinds of Uzis are still in use by the special forces today. It is being replaced by the MP-5 slowly.

Uzis were invented by Uziel Gal. This gun was first used in 1956. Uzis were used in the 1967 Six Day War by Israel.

Adam Clayton (born 13 March 1960 in Chinnor, Oxfordshire, England) is the bassist for the rock band U2. He lives in County Dublin now, and he has a house in Southern France too.

When Adam was five years old, he and his family moved to Malahide near Dublin. He started playing guitar when he went to school. He joined the other members of the future U2 band in the same time. Their band was first named "Feedback" and then they changed its name to "The Hype". However, they released their second album on 1981 under the name of U2.
All other U2 members were married by 2006, and Adam was the only member who was still single. In 2006, it was announced that Adam was going to marry Suzanne "Susie" Smith; they dated for almost 10 years before this news was announced. They were planning to marry in the summer of 2007, but they split up in February 2007..

Even though economics is all about choice on the basis of what is available rather than what should be available, the overwhelming question relates to who decides how resources should be distributed and how economics can embrace a trade-off between different groups which each seek to maximize their allocation of resources. If "what should be" cannot be incorporated, the subject of economics will be as dry as desert as described by Ayn Rand. The challenge therefore is to construct a model combining "what is" to "what should be" and make the same acceptable to common man as well as politicians. Not being able to sell the idea as such is a defeat to the discipline. The issue is that of influence and not of theory, as Adam Smith perceived that no group of business men ever met other than to exploit the consumer.

The Hourglass Dolphin is small and wide compared to other dolphins. It only lives in the very cold waters of the Antarctic It was hardly ever seen until a drawing was made of it in 1820. Only 6 Hourglass dolphins have been examined by scientists. Boats don't usually go where they live.
The Hourglass Dolphin is black and white and for this reason was called the "sea cow". On each side there is a white patch that looks a little like an hourglass shape. That is how it got it's name. and hence the common name of the dolphin.
An adult is about 1.8 m in length and weighs 90-120 kg. Males are probably smaller and lighter than females, but we dont know for sure.
If you are where it lives in is easy to tell from other dolphins. There is only one other dolphin that is as small in the area.
Hourglass Dolphins usually stay in groups of 5-10. Once a group of 60 was recorded. They like to ride the bow of boats. There are usually Fin Whales with them. It is thought they eat small fish and squid.
The Hourglass Dolphin stays around the Antarctic. Some have been seen from the south of New Zealand and Chile. We think there are at least 140,000 of them.

The Zhou Dynasty defeated the Shang Dynasty using the mandate of heaven and said they were immoral at about 3000 BC, and came to power. They changed the capital from Henan to a place near present day Xi'an, near the Yellow River. The Zhou Dynasty also brought a new theory. This theory told the people that kings had the order of the gods to rule the country (mandate of heaven). Almost all dynasties of Chinese rulers continued to repeat this theory. The kings of this dynasty won many new areas. For the first time in the history of China, large number of persons also moved from one area to other area for settlement.
During the Zhou Dynasty, the origins of matured Chinese philosophy developed. The greatest Chinese philosophers were "Kong Fuzi" (Latin: Confucius), founder of Confucianism, and Laozi, founder of Daoism. Other philosophers, theorists, and schools of thought in this era were Mozi (Latin: Micius), founder of "Mohism", Mengzi (Latin: Mencius), a famous Confucian who expanded upon Kong Fuzi's legacy, Shang Yang and Han Feizi, responsible for the development of ancient Chinese Legalism (the core philosophy of the Qin Dynasty), and Xunzi.

"Always" is the most recent single by Sum 41, released on their first compilation album '. It is the only new song on the record, recorded especially for this release, and was released as a radio single on December 9, 2008.
Although the album was released on November 26, 2008, the song was released to the public for free listening on the Universal Japan website on November 11, 2008.

"Always" is not a typical Sum 41 song. It switches tempos back and forth during the whole song, from an acoustic slow intro to an up-tempo verse and chorus, up until a quiet piano break, again into an up-tempo chorus, and back to a totally stripped acoustic slow break from the whole tempo of the song. The song features a prominent use of piano and acoustic guitar, and has a much heavier sound then the one present on the band's last album "Underclass Hero".
Like the band's last effort, "Underclass Hero", the song was totally produced, mixed and engineered by lead singer Deryck Whibley himself.

A cabal is a group of people who try to control things in a secret way.
Sometimes people say "There Is No Cabal", or use the abbreviation TINC to mean "There Is No Cabal".
A cabal does not mean people who are in power because they are meant to have power. A cabal means people who have more power than they are meant to have.

One new example of the use of the word Cabal is that the former chief of staff, Lawrence Wilkerson, of the Secretary of State Colin Powell said that the foreign policy of George W. Bush's administration were run by a "Cheney-Rumsfeld cabal". With this word he meant that the President had not really the power that he is given by the constitution and that the Vice President and the Secretary of Defense had more influence than they should have.

With Act of Union 1800 (or sometimes Act of Union 1801) (Irish: "Acht an Aontais 1800") is used to describe two Acts are meant. Their official titles are the Union with Ireland Act 1800 (1800 c.67 39 and 40 Geo 3), an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain, and the Act of Union (Ireland) 1800 (1800 c.38 40 Geo 3), an Act of the Parliament of Ireland.
These two Acts merged the Kingdom of Ireland and the unified Kingdom of Great Britain, (being itself a merger of the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland under the Acts of Union 1707), to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

The flag created as a consequence of the merger combined the flags of England and Scotland with "St Patrick's Cross" to represent Ireland. However, Wales is not included on the Union Flag, as when the original Union Flag was devised Wales was considered a part of the Kingdom of England.

It was found by Annibale de Gasparis on April 5, 1853. The mass and diameter appearing in the table are from different sources, and combining them gives an unusually high density, which is most probably wrong. The mass has very likely been overestimated by a factor of at least five times.
It is named after Themis, the personification of divine order, law and custom in Greek mythology.

Mosses are non-vascular plants. They grow in forests and on logs. They live where it is cool and wet. Because they lack a circulatory system, and therefore the means to transport nutrients around their structures, they cannot grow very large.
A moss does not make seeds. A moss does not have fruit. When a moss grows, it makes tiny spores instead. The spores are like dust. They come from a little box that grows up out of the moss. The box has a lid that falls off. Then the spores come out and float away. They will make more moss.

"Helicobacter pylori" ("H. pylori") is a spiral shaped bacterium that lives in or on the lining of the stomach. It causes more than 90 percent of ulcers, which are sores in the lining of the stomach or the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine). Before 1982, when this bacterium was discovered, doctors thought that spicy food, acid, stress and lifestyle caused most ulcers. Because doctors now know that most ulcers are caused by an "H. pylori" infection, they can be cured with the correct antibiotics.
"Heliobacter pylori" was first discovered by Australian scientists, Barry J. Marshall and J. Robin Warren. They won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2005 for their work.

The 1908 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the IV Olympiad, were held in 1908 in London, England. These games were originally scheduled to be held in Rome. At the time, they were the fifth modern Olympic games. However, it was later decided that the 1906 Summer Olympics would not be considered an official Olmpiad.
Italian authorities were preparing for the Games when Mount Vesuvius erupted on April 7, 1906, devastating the nearby city of Naples. Money that would have gone to the Olympics in Rome were used to help re-construct Naples.

The gracile australopithecines (of the genus "Australopithecus"; Latin "australis" "of the south", Greek "pithekos" "ape") are a group of extinct hominids that were closely related to humans.

Gracile australopithecines shared several traits with modern apes and humans. They were widespread throughout Eastern and Northern Africa 3-3.9 million years ago. The earliest evidence for this species was found at a site of Laetoli in Tanzania. These footprints found are similar to those of modern humans. They have been positively dated as 3.7 million years old. Until recently, the footprints were categorized as Australopithecine. This is because the species was thought to be the only pre-human known to have existed in that region at that time. However, some scholars have considered reclassifying them under a very early species of the genus Homo.

Smilodon was the largest saber-toothed cat (or saber-toothed tiger). It was a fierce predator about 4-5 feet (1.2-1.5 m) long and 3 feet (0.9 m) tall. It weighed about 440 lbs (200 kg). It was a bit smaller than a modern-day lion, but much heavier.

It had relatively short legs and a short, bobbed tail. Its front legs were especially powerful. Its body was adapted for springing onto prey, but it was not a very fast runner.

During the last Ice Age, there were many large, interesting mammals, like the saber-toothed cats, giant ground sloths, mastodons, and mammoths. These animals have long since gone extinct and are known mostly from fossils, frozen, mummified carcasses, and from ancient cave drawings. The pressures of a major climate change probably led to their extinction; human hunting may have made their situation even worse.

The Republic of Zimbabwe is a country in the southern part of the continent of Africa. Its capital city is Harare. President Robert Mugabe is the leader of the country.

Zimbabwe is surrounded by other countries, and so it has no coast on the sea. This type of country is called "landlocked". The countries that surround Zimbabwe are Zambia, Botswana, South Africa and Mozambique.
Zimbabwe is home to the famous waterfall, Victoria Falls, which are a feature of the river Zambezi and also the Great Zimbabwe, the ancient architectural monument from which the country was named after.

Zimbabwe was known as Rhodesia when it was a colony of Great Britain, but it took the ancient name of "Zimbabwe" in 1980 when it became an independent country.

Zimbabwe uses the Zimbabwe dollar as its currency. The economy is currently in a bad situation. Foreign currency reserves are at very low levels, and the Zimbabwean Dollar has become very devalued. Just recently, three zeroes were taken off the Zimbabwean dollar (for example, $1,000,000 (one million dollars) would become $1000 (one thousand dollars)). Many observers link this to Mugabe's controversial Land Reform programme.

A road is a piece of land which connects two or more places. Usually, a road has been made easy to travel on, for example by removing trees and stones so the ground is more level. Although many roads are made of gravel and dirt, some are made of concrete or brick.
People have been making roads for a long time. Roman roads and the Incan courier roads are famous. But transport by river was usually easier and faster than transport by road. In the industrial revolution, the railway was invented. A railway is a special type of road, using rails. Roads are now usually made for wheeled vehicles, like cars, to travel on.
Road building and care is usually paid for by taxes. Some roads have tolls, where people pay to use the road.

The substances that are steroids for vertebrates are either hormones, or cholesterol. Steroids can kill people, and they have many side effects for both men and women. They are common in sports, but also in other areas.

Whales are marine mammals, because most of them live in the oceans.
The term "whale" can be used for all Cetaceans, or only for some. For all of the order, including dolphins and porpoises, see Cetacea.
They are often very large. Whales are not fish; like other mammals, they breathe oxygen from the air, and have a small amount of hair, and warm blood. Whales come in various shapes and sizes. Whales used to be killed for oil by whalers. However, many countries have passed laws saying that no one is allowed to kill whales anymore. Some people still do kill whales, even though it is illegal. Also, some countries have not made it illegal, while others make it legal only for native people.

Whales are widely classed as predators, but their food ranges from microscopic plankton to very large fish. Males are called bulls; females, cows. The young are called calves.
Because of their environment (and unlike many animals), whales are conscious breathers: they decide when to breathe. All mammals sleep, including whales, but they cannot afford to buy there own chocolate so somebody nice comes along and buys it unconscious state for too long, since they need to be conscious in order to breathe. It is thought that only one hemisphere of their brains sleeps at a time, so that whales are never completely asleep, but still get the rest they need. Whales are thought to sleep around 8 hours a day

A tendon (or sinew) is a tough band of tissue that connects muscle to bone. It is built to withstand tension. Tendons are similar to ligaments except that ligaments join one bone to another. Tendons and muscles work together. They can only create a pulling force.

The beginning of a tendon is where it connects to a muscle. Collagen fibers from the inside of the muscle are the same as those of the tendon. A tendon inserts into bone at an enthesis. At this point, the collagen fibers are changed into bone tissue. Tendons can not create any pulling force of their own. The tendons transfer the movement of muscles. They can create an elastic force if stretched.

Pier Gerlofs Donia, 1480 - 1520. He fought for the independence of Friesland. He was an enormous man and was said to be well over 7 feet tall. Donia was also known as Grutte Pier'", which means "Big Lad", in Frisian language, or Grote Pier, which means the same in Dutch language. He also was a pirate. This great man fought against the people from Holland, Germany, and the Burgundians. In his biggest battle at sea he captured 28 ships, and he killed all 500 men who had been taken prisoner. "Big Lad" was then called the "Cross of the Dutchman".
Those prisoners who could not answer this in proper Frisian had their heads cut off by Donia himself. Pier was also noted for his ability to behead several people with a single blow. This meant he could kill many enemies at the same time during battle, and gave him an excellent advantage over his opponents. His famous fighting skills proved their worth in many battles.
Despite his many successes, Pier could not defeat the Burgundian/Hapsburg armies. He retired disillusioned in 1519. He died peacefully in bed in the Frisian town of Sneek on October 28 in the year 1520. His last words were spoken to his life-time enemy, the count of Nychlenborch. He was asked by the count were he wanted to go after he died, to which Pier replied "Nea myn Heer ta" ("To my Lord"). He then passed away. After the "Giant of Kimswerd" (another nickname) died, Friesland never again earned its freedom. It has remained a province of the Netherlands.

Investment or investing means that an asset is bought, or that money is put into a bank to get a future interest from it.
Literally, the word means the "action of putting something in to somewhere else" (perhaps originally related to a person's garment or 'vestment').

The major difference in the use of the term investment between the economics field and the finance field is that economists refer to a real investment (such as a machine or a house), while financial economists refer to a financial asset, such as money that is put into a bank or the market, which may then be used to buy a real asset. An important thing to know about investing is that even when the times are tough that is the time when you most need to hold on to your investment.

The investment decision (also known as "capital budgeting") is one of the fundamental decisions of business management.

"For the band, see U2 (band)."
The U-2 (nicknamed the Dragon Lady) is an espionage fixed-wing aircraft made by Lockheed (now Lockheed Martin). It first flew in 1955 and was introduced in 1957. It flies a lot like a glider. It was made during the Cold War, because the United States needed a way to look at the Soviet military from high up. Taiwan also used it to spy on China.
The United States wanted to keep the purpose of the U-2 secret, but on May 1, 1960, Francis Gary Powers was shot down in his U-2 by a Soviet SAM SA-2 missile. In 1962, Powers was released and traded for captured Soviet spy Rudolf Abel. After this, the SR-71 Blackbird started spying on the Soviet Union, which was faster and harder to see on radar.
The U-2 is still in service even though the design is over 50 years old.

The U-2S is 62.99 feet (19.20 meters) long, 104.99 feet (32 meters wide), and is 15.75 feet (4.80 meters) tall. It weighs 14,991 pounds (6,800 kilograms) empty, but when full, it weighs 41,006 pounds (18,600 kilograms). It is powered by one General Electric F118-101 engine with 17,000 pounds (7711.2 kilograms) of thrust. It can go 475 miles per hour (764 kilometers per hour), fly 7,000 miles (11,265 kilometers) without refueling, and can fly 69,593 feet (21,212 meters) high.

The ONS coding system is a system used in the United Kingdom for dealing with census and other statistical data. It is used by the Office for National Statistics as a way to label each area of England and Wales. It is also used for parts of Northern Ireland. The system uses a code for the larger census areas, counties and districts. It then breaks those areas down into smaller areas within the larger areas. Each of the smaller areas get a code that is based on the larger area. Areas are divided in this way until they get to the smallest size used for census data. An area must have at least 40 households, but they try to not divide an area into a size smaller than 100 households.

The Jurassic Coast is a special bit of coastline that is between Orcombe Point near Exmouth in East Devon to Old Harry Rocks near Swanage in East Dorset. This is on the south coast of England. It is 95 miles or 153 kilometres long. It is particularly special because it is a World Heritage Site, these are made by UNESCO.

The Jurassic Coast is made of Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous cliffs, spanning 180 million years of geological history.
The site contains a number of special features and shows different landforms, including the natural arch at Durdle Door, the cove and limestone folding at Lulworth Cove and an island, the Isle of Portland. Chesil Beach is a example of both a tombolo and a storm beach. The site has concordant and discordant coastlines. Because the Jurassic Coast is so special, the site is being looked at as an International Study. This area was home to Mary Anning, a palaeontologist who looked at the fossils of the coastline around Lyme Regis and discovered the first complete Ichthyosaur fossil. One place called Golden Cap is special because it is the highest place on all the south coast of England. It is high.

Chorizo is a pork (pig-meat) sausage which people first made in Spain. In it there is fatty pork in large pieces, with chili pepper and paprika. The special taste of this sausage comes from the mild Spanish paprika in it.
In the western hemisphere, people know the Mexican and Caribbean sorts better. In these sorts of chorizo, the pork is in much smaller pieces. Different seasonings are also in it with the chili.
People eat chorizo without cooking it, or they fry it in oil. People also use it as a part of other dishes, the same way they eat breakfast sausage. It can also be used in place of ground beef or pork.

The economy of India is the 12th largest in the world with a GDP (a year's goods and services) of $568 billion (U.S.). If you consider PPP (how much that money can buy in India compared to other countries), the economy is fourth largest (worth $3.319 trillion U.S.). The growth rate is 6.2%. However, that is still only $3100 (considering PPP) per person per year.
India's economy includes agriculture, handicrafts, industries, and a lot of services. Services are the main source of economic growth in India today, though two-thirds of Indian people earn their living directly or indirectly through agriculture. In recent times, due to its large number of well-educated people who can speak English, India sells a lot of computer programs to other countries.
For most of India's independent history, it had strict government controls in many areas such as telecommunications (communication over long distances), banking and foreign direct investment. Since the early 1990s, India has slowly opened up its markets by reducing government control on foreign trade and investment.
The social and economic problems India faces are the increasing population, poverty, lack of infrastructure (buildings, roads, etc.) and growing unemployment. Although poverty has gone down 10% since the 1980s, a quarter of India's citizens still cannot pay for enough food.

Special English is a simple form of the English language used by a public radio station called Voice of America, run by United States government in daily Special English programs. Its news and feature programs are read more slowly than usual, using a limited number of English words and simple grammar.
For those whose mother language is not English, it is much easier to understand contents of programs, because it sounds clearer and simpler, and shorter sentences are used in articles. It can also help someone whose English is weak to improve his or her English. In some countries, for example China, Special English is more and more popular among people learning English.
Special English was first used on October 19, 1959.

A machine gun is a weapon that can fire one bullet after another as long as the trigger is pulled and there are bullets ready to fire. This is called automatic fire. Some machine guns can be carried by one person. Some machine guns have to be fired from a stand with three legs called a tripod. Many machine guns fire bullets connected together in a long chain called a belt. Others use spring loaded boxes called magazines.
Similar weapons that fire less powerful bullets are called sub-machine guns (SMG).

Duct tape is a very strong adhesive tape with a cloth backing. Usually duct tape is grey or black, but it is made in other colors including transparent. People use duct tape to repair many things, for example a broken handbag or a broken chair.
Duct tape was designed during World War II. It was first used to keep water out of ammunition cases. It was found to work so well that people started using it to fix many other things. Duct tape was also called "100 mph tape" by the military because it is said the tape will still stick in winds at speeds of 100 miles per hour. Duct tape got its name from its use on heating and air conditioning ducts but oddly enough, that is the one use that the tape is not very good for. It is illegal in California to use duct tape on ducts and most professional builders in the United States are not allowed to use it either.
In the United States, people use duct tape in many action movies and television shows. Strips of duct tape can be used to tie a person up because it is very hard to get them off.

A metamorphic rock is a type of rock that is formed when its pre-existing rock is changed. It's name is derived from the the word "morph", meaning change.
That will happen if different temperature and pressure conditions than those in which the original rock was formed occur. These temperatures and pressures are always higher than those at the Earth's surface and must be sufficiently high that they change the original minerals into other mineral types or into other forms of the same minerals (e.g. by recrystallisation) under the pressure of Earth's crust over long periods of time.

The IUCN Red List (also IUCN Red List of Threatened Species) is a list of species. The list tells for each species how likely it is to become extinct (or if it is already). This is called its conservation status. This list is complied each year by the World Conservation Union.
There are exact criteria to see if a certain species is threatened to become extinct. These criteria are the same for all regions of the world. The aim of the list is to tell people how threatened a certain species is. Politicians can then decide on the priorities and the efforts needed to save certain species from becoming extinct.

Malcolm X was an African American nationalist and civil rights activist. At first, his actions and speeches were mostly inspired by the beliefs and teachings of the Nation of Islam. Once he learned that the leader of the "Nation of Islam" was in many relationships with women, he changed his religion to Sunni Islam. At this point, his opinions of white people got better and he soon knew that white people can be good people, too. "Malcolm X" was shot dead in New York City on February 21, 1965, on the first day of the National Brotherhood Week. Most people think that the "Nation of Islam" had a part in his murder. Malcolm X believed the end justified the means, so he believed violence was a necessary part in the fight for equality.

In physics, power (symbol: "P") is the rate at which work is performed or energy is transferred. In the SI system of measurement, power is measured in watts (symbol: W).
It may take a certain amount of work to effect a change in the world, like lifting a heavy weight to a higher level. It makes no difference if the weight is lifted slowly or quickly, the same amount of work will have been performed. The difference between a slow lift and a quick lift is that a quick lift requires more Power. That is the work can be done in a shorter time if there is more power available.

In optics, or radiometry, the term "power" sometimes refers to radiant flux, the average rate of energy transport by electromagnetic radiation, measured in watts. But the term "power" is also used to express the ability of a lens or other optical device to focus light. It is measured in dioptres (inverse metres), and is equal to one over the focal length of the optical device.

The capital city (or just capital) is a city where the central government of a country, or part of a country, such as a state, province, or county, is located.
The leaders and officials work in the capital city.
Capitals are usually large cities. For example, Montevideo is Uruguay's biggest city, and Uruguay's capital. However, a capital is not always the largest city in a country. For example, the capital of the the Republic of India is New Delhi, which is smaller than Mumbai, and the capital of Pakistan is Islamabad, which is smaller than Karachi, both Mumbai and Karachi are very big cities.
Some countries have more than one capital, like Bolivia, which has two, and South Africa, which has three. Nauru is a country that does not have a capital. Some countries change capitals from time to time.
Do not confuse "capital" with "capitol", which is a building in the capital of the United States of America.

Transfer chess (also known as Bughouse) is a version of the game, chess. It is played by four people in two teams. Each team has two players. The game is played on two chess boards. Two chess clocks can also be used. Two games of chess are played in at the same time. If a player one game captures a piece, following the regular rules of chess, they give that piece to their partner to use in the other game. The partner can put the peice on the board instead of making a normal move. Pawns can not be placed in the first or last row but other peices can be placed in any empty space. This is why the partners use opposite colored pieces.
If one player wins, that partnership wins the match. Games are usually always won by check-mating the opponent's king. Other rules can be used such as "flagfall" (which is only played when there is a clock).

The Kingdom of Kerma was a state in Nubia from around 2500 BC to about 1520 BC. It was based in the city of Kerma in Upper Nubia and was a major centre during the Middle Kingdom period of Egypt. It had a distinct civilization (for example very fine and original ceramics have been found).
The site of Kerma includes both an extensive town and a cemetery consisting of large tumuli. Because one can find there much examples of Nubian culture and burial practices at the site, scholars think that the Egyptian statues and other Egyptian objects found at Kerma arrived through trade.
In 2003, a Swiss archaeological team working in northern Sudan uncovered one of the most remarkable Egyptological finds in recent years. At the site known as Kerma, near the third cataract of the Nile, archaeologist Charles Bonnet and his team discovered a ditch within a temple from the ancient city of Pnoubs, which contained seven monumental black granite statues. Magnificently sculpted, and in an excellent state of preservation, they portrayed five pharaonic rulers, including Taharqa and Tanoutamon, the last two pharaohs of the 'Nubian' Dynasty, when Egypt was ruled by kings from the lands of modern-day Sudan. For over half a century, the Nubian pharaohs governed a combined kingdom of Egypt and Nubia, with an empire stretching from the Delta to the upper reaches of the Nile.

Responsible government is a principle of some democratic governments. It has nothing to do with whether a government has responsibility.
In the government of a country that uses responsible government, the leaders of the executive branch of government (called the cabinet) are also members of the legislature. Also, the cabinet must have the support of the majority of the legislature to stay in power. If it loses the support of the legislature, there will be an election or a different political party will make a new cabinet.
Countries that use responsible government usually have parliamentary systems of government. Some examples of countries that have responcible government are the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia.
In countries that do not have responsible government, the cabinet and the legislature are each elected separately. This system has more separation of powers than a system with responsible government and is called. Some examples of countries that "do not" have a system of responsible government are the United States and France.

Geta are traditional Japanese sandals. They are stilted to keep the hem of a kimono above the ground. They are worn with tabi socks. Geta makes the person's feet stay out of the mud.
Usually Japanese people wear them with a casual kimono rather than formal one. It is common to wear them with bare feet when a yukata is worn. Also they are worn with western clothes.
Today, in Japan, most people rarely wear kimono and rarely wear geta. One reason for this is most gravel roads were changed to asphalt roads for Tokyo Olympic. Since 1995, the number of people who wear geta casually increased because of the pretty looks and sounds. In addition, the popularity of geta grew little by little through trend for yukata. At one time, Japanese people thought that it is hard to walk with geta and sometimes get injured by hanao. Hanao is a rope which is set between the big toe and second toe when geta are worn. However, because of efforts by yukata makers and footwear makers, Japanese people are starting to like to wear geta again.

Water buffalos are a kind of bovine. There are Wild Asian Water Buffalos and domestic buffalos or domestic Asian water buffalo. They occur (or rather, are bred) in Asia, South America and Southern Europe. They were bred from the Wild Asian Water Buffalo, which is now an endangered species.
Today, these buffalos are used for their milk, which has more fat than that of cows. The milk is processed to make Mozzarella, and curd. Feral populations are sometimes used to manage uncontrolled growth of vegetation around wetlands, they will simply graze it off. This keeps such bodies of water usable by birds and other wildlife.

Sapphire is the non-red type of the mineral corundum, an aluminium oxide (Al2O3). It can be found naturally or it can be made in large crystal. Blue sapphires are the most famous kind, but they can be of many different colors, like amber and orange.
Sapphires have long history. Tradition says that the tablets of the Ten Commandments were made of sapphire, so strong a hammer could not break them, and would break instead if it hit them. The ancient Persians believed that the earth lied on a giant sapphire and its reflection colored the sky. Many other cultures believe that sapphires could be used to heal and calm people.
Sapphires have been used by royalty throughout the ages as a symbol of good fortune, virtue, wisdom and holiness. Princess Diana and Princess Anne both received sapphire engagement rings and the British Crown Jewels are full of large blue sapphires, the symbol of pure and wise rulers.
Sapphire is the birthstone of September. It symbolizes sincerity and faithfulness.

Mammals are a group of vertebrate animals. They form the class "Mammalia".
A mammal is any animal that produces and feeds its young with milk and is warm-blooded; the heat they need to live is made inside their body. The milk is made by glands in the skin or the mammary glands.
There are only five mammals that lay eggs, called Monotremes (for example the platypus). Almost all mammals give birth to living young. Those mammals can be divided into the Marsupials and the
Eutheria, the placental mammals. Marsupials are mammals with pouches to carry young in, like the kangaroo. The Eutheria are all other mammals.
Most mammals have four limbs and a coat of hair, wool or fur.

The AWD-Arena is a football stadium in Hanover, a city in north Germany. It is the home stadium of the football club Hannover 96. The AWD-Arena was built from 1952 to 1954 and called "Niedersachsenstadion" (stadium of lower Saxony). Lower Saxony is a German federal state and Hanover is its capital.
Originally the Niedersachsenstadium was large enough to hold about 80.000 people. It was changed for international football championships in 1974 and 1988, especially changing standing room into seats. In 2003, it became changed to be used only for football and the name was sold to the German company of AWD. Today it can hold 49.000 people.
In 2006, the Football World Championships were played there.

Objectivity in science means that scientific measurement can be tested independent from the individual scientist (the subject) who proposes them.
To be properly considered objective, the results of measurement must be communicated from person-to-person, and then "demonstrated" for third parties, as an advance in understanding of the objective world. Such demonstrable knowledge would ordinarily confer demonstrable powers of prediction or technological construction.

To avoid the variety in subjective (equivocal) interpretation of quantifying terms such as "green", "hot", "large", "considerable", and "negligible", scientists strive, where possible, to eliminate human senses by use of standartized measuring tools (meter stick, stopwatch, thermometer, etc) and mechanical/electronic measuring instruments (spectrometer, voltmeter, timer, oscilloscope, gravimeter, etc) for performing the actual measuring process, eliminating much of the perceptive variability of individual observers. The results of measurements are expressed on a numerical scale of standard units - so that everybody else understands them the same way. Where data must need be used, the ideal is to use "hard", "objective" criteria for assigning the classifications (see definition), such that different classifiers would produce the same assignments.

Everything2 or E2 is a website. It lets people make pages about many different things, and some people use it as a diary.
E2 users create pages called "nodes" and add stuff in "writeups". Only logged-in users can create writeups. Only the person who created the writeup or someone who the website owners (called "gods") choose can edit the writeup. On the other hand, on Wikipedia, anyone can edit pages, but on Everything2 only those who can edit the writeup can edit pages.
Everything2 does not require a neutral point of view like Wikipedia does. So, it is possible to have more than one article (writeups) under the same title (node), each by different authors, and presenting different points of view.

A Lunar eclipse is an astronomical phenomenon. It occurs when the moon passes through the shadow of the Earth. Lunar eclipses occur about twice a year, much more often than solar eclipses. They also last longer than solar eclipses
During a lunar eclipse, the Moon appears a reddish-brown color. You would probably think that the moon would be completely black because of Earth's shadow, but the reddish-brown color is due to the fact that the Sun's light reflects off Earth, and is barely visible on the Moon.
Like solar eclipses, there are different types of lunar eclipses. There are total eclipses, where all of the moon appears reddish-brown, and partial ones, where only part of the moon appears reddish-brown.
Lunar eclipses don't happen every month due to the fact that the Moon's orbit is tilted.

Amphibians are a group of vertebrate animals. They form the class "Amphibia". "Amphi-"means both and "bios" refers to life.
They have four legs and are born from eggs. They live in the water as babies, and can go on land when they grow up. Frogs, salamanders, toads and caecilians are all amphibians.
Amphibians are born without legs, and grow legs as babies. When they grow up, they change shape, or metamorphosize. They eventually lose their gills and tails, and grow front and hind legs. Baby frogs, toads, or salamanders are called "tadpoles". They lay as many as 1000 eggs, usually in the water or in wet places. They eat other animals, especially insects.
Amphibians are cold blooded, wich means that their body temperature doesn't adapt to the weather.
There are about 5,700 living species of amphibians.

El Toro ("The Bull") is a wooden rollercoaster at Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson, New Jersey, United States. It was opened (people could go on it) on June 11, 2006. It has the steepest drop of any wooden rollercoaster in the world, at 76 degrees. It is 188ft tall, a world record breaking drop on a wooden roller coaster, and goes at a maximum (highest possible) speed of 113km/h. The speed can be different. During the day it goes faster and faster. It begins at 108km/h and by the end of the day it travels at 118km/h. It has 4,400 feet of track, and the trains are known to not really slow down much through the whole ride. El Toro is also known for it's strong "airtime" (when riders would be thrown out of the seats if the restraints were not there).

El Toro is quite different than most other wooden rollercoasters because it is made out prefabricated track, which means that the pieces of track were cut in a factory and do not need to be cut by hand. This makes the time to build El Toro much shorter. Since it uses prefabricated track, the ride is very smooth. Most wooden rollercoasters are known to be quite rough.

A chemical property is a property, quality or way that an object is. A chemical property cannot usually be measured without changing or making the object chemically different or different in a way that would affect its chemical or atomic structure. This is different than the physical property of the substance because this property is only shown when the substance is reacting or changing its chemistry; because of this it is difficult to see a chemical property. Chemical properties are determined with an experiment or a highly developed model.

North Yorkshire is a large county in the English Region called Yorkshire and the Humber in the north of England.
North Yorkshire was part of one big county called Yorkshire. The three parts of Yorkshire used to be called the West Riding, the East Riding, and the North Riding. in 1974, the boundaries and names changed. The "North Riding" changed to "North Yorkshire". The other main parts of Yorkshire are now South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, and the East Riding of Yorkshire.
The main city of North Yorkshire is York. York is now since 1996 a unitary authority, it is not officially part of North Yorkshire.
Yorkshire has many towns. It also has many open green areas and hills, so two of the 11 UK National Parks (the North York Moors and most of the Yorkshire Dales) are in North Yorkshire.

A mahasiddha (Sanskrit: "maha" - great, "siddha" - achiever) is type of yogi important in Tantra. They are found in both Hinduism and Tibetan Buddhism. They are connected with unusual ways of thinking and with the highest levels of spiritual enlightenment. They are very different from arhats, the saints who gave up the world to achieve Buddhahood.
The Mahasiddhas are actual people who lived in the past who had magical powers because of their spiritual practice. A mahasiddha is a bodhisattva, someone who can enter "nirvana" whenever they want, but instead choose to stay in "samsara" to help others.
In both Hindu and Tibetan Buddhist traditions there are 84 Mahasiddhas. The lists are not all the same, but there are many Mahasiddhas who appear on most lists. In Tibetan Buddhist art, they are often shown in paintings together, for example around the border of a "thanka".

In Buddhist pictures and statues, Milarepa is shown with his right hand cupped against his ear. He does this to better listen to the teachings "(dharma)".

The International Date Line (IDL), also known as just the Date Line, is an imaginary line on the surface of the Earth, going from north to south in the Pacific Ocean. The date becomes one day later as one travels across it in western direction, and one day earlier as one travels across it in eastern direction.
The reason for this effect is that the countries on the eastern side of the International Date Line, (located in or outside eastern Asia) have the time zone 10-12 hours more than Greenwich. And the countries on western side of it (Alaska/Hawaii and other areas) have the time zone 9-12 hours less than Greenwich. So when travelling across the line, one's watch has to be adjusted 20-24 hours, depending on the time zones.
For example New Zealand has got the time zone Greenwich+12 hours, and Hawaii has got the time zone Greenwich-10 hours. When travelling from New Zealand to Hawaii the clocks must be switched 22 hours backwards, about one day.

The Klingon language (named "tlhIngan Hol" in Klingon) is a language that was made for the Klingons in the "Star Trek" universe. It is an invented language. This means that there is no country that uses the language. Only few people can really speak the Klingon language. The Klingon Language Institute helps people learn Klingon.

The first Klingon words were made by the actor James Doohan in 1979 for the first Star Trek movie. When they made the third movie in 1984, Gene Roddenberry wanted to have a real language for the Klingons. So it was the linguist (a language scientist) Marc Okrand who made the Klingon language. He has written some books about the Klingon language.

The Klingon language feels like talking backwards. Marc Okrand wanted the language to be as complicated as possible. He did this to make it sound very extraterrestrial. The word order in a sentence is always object-verb-subject. So the English sentence "I see the cat" is said as "the cat see I" in Klingon.

A price is a value people think something is worth. This is usually measured as money.
Let's say Peter raises sheep. Sally raises ducks. Winter is coming, and Sally wants some sheepskin coat to make her feel warm.
She could now first calculate how much sheepskin she would need for a coat. Lets say she needs 2 sheep skins for that coat. She would then go to Peter and ask him how much he wants for the two sheep skins she needs. Peter would then likely tell a price. Alternatively Sally could trade some of her ducks for the sheepskins.
Since trading ducks for sheep is rather complicated, people introduced something they called "money". This is simply used for trading. So sally would trade some of her ducks for money. Some of this money she could then give to Peter to get the sheepskin. The same type of thing is happening in the real world.

Walter Scheel (born July 8, 1919) is a German politician (FDP).

During World War II, he served in the Luftwaffe, the last years of the war as a Radar operator on a Me 110 night fighter.
He was federal minister of economic cooperation and development (1961-1966), but he persuaded the FDP to leave Ludwig Erhard's coalition government in late 1966. This forced elections in Germany, and Kurt Georg Kiesinger became chancellor.
In 1969 his party formed a new coalition with the Social Democrats. He became Foreign Minister and Vice Chancellor. With Willy Brandt his foreign policy meant the Federal Republic of Germany promised not to try and get back the parts of Germany given to Poland and the USSR. The treaty with Poland actually defined the western border of Poland, not the border between Poland and Germany. It is the same thing, but meant Poland could sign a treaty with West Germany that described the border of East Germany.
When Brandt resigned on May 7 1974, Scheel, was acting chancellor, for about a week, until Helmut Schmidt was elected Chancellor.
A few weeks later, Scheel was elected Federal President of West Germany, a post he held from July 1974 until June 1979.
Like most ex German presidents, Scheel retired from political life term ended. He did sometimes appears on political talk shows or events. At the funeral of the murdered businessman Hanns Martin Schleyer in October 1977, Scheel gave a speech entitled "shame".

A degree is a document that a student receives when they graduate from a school to show that they completed all their classes. This is also called a diploma.
Before college, high schools are usually the only schools that give out actual degrees or diplomas to graduating students. Some middle schools have also started to do this to make students feel like they have accomplished more.
Academic degrees are degrees that are given out by places of higher education such as universities and colleges. In many English-speaking countries these degrees are shown by letters which the person is allowed to put after their name, e.g. John Smith, BA. A bachelor's degree is usually the degree received at the end of a course. While the student is studying for a degree he or she is an "undergraduate". When he graduates he is a "graduate". He may continue with his studies and receive a Master's Degree or do some original work and write a "thesis" (like a book) to get a Doctor's degree (which does not mean a Doctor of medicine).

Dundee FC currently play in the Scottish First Division, having been relegated from the Scottish Premier League in 2005. The team is currently managed by Alex Rae, who played for the club but recently retired from professional football. Rae was appointed on 24 May 2006, following the sacking of Alan Kernaghan. For the past three seasons they have failed to gain promotion back to the top tier as they finished 7th in 2005-2006, 3rd in 2006-2007 and 2nd in 2007-2008. In the 2005-2006 Dundee managed to reach the Scottish Cup semi-final but were beaten 3-0 by Gretna, then a Scottish Second Division side.
Unusually for a city of its size, Dundee supports two senior professional football teams, Dundee FC and Dundee United. Their grounds are within a few hundred yards of each other and are the two closest professional football grounds in the United Kingdom.

Microeconomics is the science of how people make decisions at the small scale. The opposite is macroeconomics. In microeconomics, we might watch how a person chooses what to buy at the store, or how many things a company will make. Some parts of microeconomics include "Consumer Theory" and "Theory of the Firm", which study how people and businesses make decisions. "Game Theory" watches how people make decisions when the outcome (how something ends) depends on what decision another person makes.

The Geneva Conventions are a set of four treaties of international law. They were formulated in Geneva, Switzerland. All of the four treaties are about humanitarian issues. The Swiss Henri Dunant was the person who started the creation of the conventions. He did this after he saw the unimaginable cruelty of the Battle of Solferino in 1859.
Some parts of the four Geneva Conventions say that all states who signed must create national laws to make violations of the Geneva Conventions a crime.
After the First Convention was agreed, the International Committee of the Red Cross was founded in 1863.
All four conventions were last checked and agreed in 1949. Those versions are related to previous revisions. In some cases, ideas from the 1907 Hague Conventions were added. Usually, people refer to all four conventions as the "Geneva Conventions of 1949" or simply the "Geneva Conventions". Later conferences have added text that forbids certain methods of warfare. They have also spoken about issues of civil wars. Nearly all 200 countries of the world are "signatory" nations, in that they have signed and ratified these conventions.
Clara Barton was important in campaigning for the agreement of the First Geneva Convention by the United States; the U.S. signed in 1882. By the Fourth Geneva Convention some 47 nations had ratified the agreements.

List of U.S. states by traditional abbreviation
This is a list of traditional abbreviations for U.S. states and territories. These abbreviations (short names) were used in mailing addresses before the introduction of two-letter U.S. postal abbreviations. The traditional abbreviations are still commonly used in other ways besides mailing addresses. For example, they can be used in writing after a city (like in "Miami, Fla."). In 1987, the Secretary of Commerce switched to the two-letter State Alpha Code for state abbreviations.

The phenotype of an individual organism describes one of its traits or characteristics. This trait is measurable. Only some individuals of that population will show the trait.. Examples include
"blue eyes", or "aggressive behavior". Some phenotypes are controlled entirely by the individual's genes. Others are controlled by genes but can be influenced by environmental factors. Still other phenotypes are entirely nongenetic, for example, a person's language or physical traits that were altered by surgery.
Many phenotypes are determined by many genes and can also be influenced by environmental factors. Thus, the identity of one or a few alleles of an organism does not always enable prediction of its phenotype.
Scientists use easily observable phenotypes to deduce an organism's genotype. They analyse complex phenotypes to help hypothesize about how individual genes work.

A volcano is a mountain where lava (very hot, molten rock) comes from a magma chamber under the ground. Most volcanoes have a crater at the top. Materials which pour out from it usually include lava, steam, gaseous compounds of sulphur, ash and broken rock fragments. Lava is called magma before it has come out of the volcano. Volcanoes are also found on planets other than Earth, like the Olympus Mons on Mars.
The word "volcano".
"Volcano" is thought to come from Vulcano, a volcanic island in the Aeolian Islands of Italy. Vulcano's name itself is taken from Vulcan, the name of a god of fire in Roman mythology. The study of volcanoes is called "volcanology", which is sometimes spelled "vulcanology".

Volcanoes are usually made when two tectonic plates move toward each other. When these two plates meet, one of them (usually the ocean plate) goes under the other one. Afterwards, it melts and forms magma (inside the magma chamber), and the pressure builds up until the magma bursts through the Earth's crust.

Reality television is a genre of television programming which presents unscripted dramatic or humorous situations, document actual events, and have ordinary people instead of professional actors. Although reality television has existed in some form or another since the early years of television, the term "reality television" is most commonly used to describe shows since 2000. Documentaries, news and sports shows are not called reality shows.
There are many different kinds of reality television shows, from game or quiz shows to surveillance-type shows, such as "Big Brother".
Critics say that the term "reality television" is not accurate. Many shows portray a modified and highly influenced form of reality, with participants put in exotic locations or abnormal situations, sometimes told to act certain ways, and with events on screen sometimes changed by editing.

Neuroscience is the scientific study of brain and mind and the whole nervous system. It helps to understand how we perceive and interact with the outside world and, in particular, how human experience and human biology influence each other.
Its studies may include genetics, biochemistry, physiology, pharmacology, and pathology of the nervous system. Traditionally it is seen as a branch of biological sciences. However, recently there has been an effort to draw together many related areas, including psychology, computer science, statistics, physics, and medicine.

Current neuroscience research activities can be very roughly divided into the following major branches, based on what they study and at what scale they study, as well as what experimental approaches they use. Individual neuroscientists, however, often work on questions that span several different subfields.

Neuroscience research from different areas can also be seen as focusing on a set of specific themes and questions. (Some of these are taken from http://www.northwestern.edu/nuin/fac/index.htm)

A Hamlet is a a small settlement, smaller than a village. Usually, all settlers in a hamlet are centered around a single economic activity. A hamlet may consist of a farm, a mill, a mine or a harbor. All the people living there would be workers on that farm, mill, mine or harbour. Hamlets, especially those with a medieval church may have resulted from a medieval village, that was abandoned for some reason.
Because of the small size of the settlement, there are usually no buildings which have a central or admninistratrive function. There usually is no church, town hall or pub. Roads and streets in the hamlet do not have names, most of the time.
In Germany, Austria, Switzerland and the Alsace region of France, such hamlets often have names that end in "-wil", "-wil(l)er", "-wyhl" or "-viller".

Hydroelectricity is electricity that is made by the movement of water. It is usually made with dams that block a river or collect water that is pumped there. When the water is "let go" the huge pressure behind the dam forces the water down shafts that lead to a turbine, this causes the turbine to turn, and electricity is produced.
Advantages of hydroelectricity are that the way in which electricity is produced harms the environment less than fossil fuels like oil. Hydroelectricity is safe and produces no waste.
Hydroelectricity is also useful when electricity is needed very quickly. Water that has been stored in a dam can be "let go" when needed, so the energy needed can be made quickly. hydroelectricity will never become extinct because of our water supply. The advantages of hydroelectricity is once the dam is built the electricity is free,no waste or pollution produced and electricity can be generated constantly.
Disadvantages are that dams can harm the land and animals around them and some people say that they just do not look good.

In chemistry, a mixture is a substance that is made up of two or more simpler substances. These substances can be chemical elements or compounds. A mixture can be a liquid, a solid, or a gas.
A mixture is not the same as a compound, which is made of two or more elements (different kinds of atoms) connected together. For instance, a mixture of the gases hydrogen and nitrogen contains hydrogen and nitrogen, not the compound ammonia which is made of hydrogen and nitrogen atoms.
A solution can be a mixture. For instance, sugar dissolved in water is a mixture.
Solids can be mixtures also. Many kinds of soil and rock are mixtures of different minerals.

The Trojan Horse is a big wooden horse from the Trojan War in Greek mythology. In the Trojan War, the Greeks were fighting against the city of Troy.
The Greeks could not enter the city or win the war. Because of this, Odysseus, one of the Greeks, thought of a way to trick them. The Greeks built a large wooden horse and left it outside the gates of the city as a present for the Trojans. The Trojans took the horse and put it inside their city, thinking it was a victory gift from the Greeks. Odysseus chose a horse so that Poseidon (God of the sea and creator of horses) would ensure them a save trip back to Greece. After the Trojan victory parties ended, the Greeks, who were hiding inside the horse, came out of it. They opened the city gates to let the other Greeks enter Troy. The Greeks easily overpowered the Trojans and took control of the city. Because of the Trojan Horse, the Greeks won the Trojan War.
Today the word "Trojan horse" is used for things that are similar to that story: something that looks good and okay, but in truth has another purpose, usually bad. An example for this is the computer virus "Trojan horse".

Proteins are large molecules built from small units known as amino acids. They are used for growth and repair, as well as for strengthening the bones. They help to make tissue and cells. They can be found in animals, plants, fungi, bacteria, and also in the human body. For example, muscles contain a lot of proteins. Body builders will eat foods with a lot of protein as an easy way to keep or gain high levels of muscles that is safer than taking steroids. Proteins form an important part in foods like milk, eggs, meat, fish, beans, and nuts. Animals eat proteins to get energy and amino acids. These amino acids are used to build new proteins that are used as enzymes, hormones, or antibodies. Protein is also very healthy and keeps you strong and makes your bones last. Proteins are essential for life.
"Proteins" were discovered by Berzelius, in 1838.

The flag of Haiti was adopted on February 25, 1986. The flag has two horizontal bands of equal height; the top stripe is blue and the bottom is red. In the center there is a white rectangle with the Coat of Arms of Haiti which consists of a palm tree with several flags at its sides. There are two cannons on either side of the palm tree. The civil flag and the ensign (the one used by commercial ships) do not have a coat of arms.
The Haitian flag was created by the revolutionary Jean-Jacques Dessalines in 1803 from the French flag (the "Tricolore"); he eliminated the white stripe and left only the blue and red stripes in the new flag.
From May 25 1964 to February 25 1986, during the dictatorship of Francois and Jean-Claude Duvalier, the country had a different flag, in red and black, and divided vertically, not horizontally.

The electronvolt, symbol eV, is used to measure energy. It is defined as the amount of energy a single electron has after being accelerated by 1 volt of electricity. Joules are used most often to measure energy, but it is sometimes useful to use electronvolts for very small amounts of energy. To convert joules into electronvolts, divide joules by the charge of an electron, which is about 1.602,
E.g. 5 J = 5/1.602 eV = 3.125 eV.
The electronvolt is often used in atomic, nuclear and particle physics.

An explosion is a very fast increase in volume and increase in energy made available. It normally makes very high temperatures and makes gases.

An explosion starts pressure waves in the medium where it happens. Explosions are categorized as deflagrations if the pressure waves are subsonic and detonations if they are supersonic. When a detonation happens, the supersonic pressure waves are named shock waves.

Unintentional explosions can be caused when chemicals are mixed together, or if pressurized containers or flammable materials are heated or exposed to flames. To cause
an explosion, pressure does not have to be present but is always a result of an explosion.
There are a number of safety measures that are used to prevent unintentional explosions. Many countries require that chemicals, fuels, and pressurized containers that may explode be labelled with warning labels. As well, many countries have regulations restricting the possession and use of potentially explosive chemicals to appropriate industrial and research uses. Many countries have transportation regulations that require potentially explosive chemicals, fuels, and pressurized containers to be transported safely.

Intentional explosions are caused when armies fire artillery or when military air forces drop bombs during a war. Intentional explosions are also used by civilians in activities such as mining, construction, and large-scale civil engineering projects such as building tunnels, roads, railways, and dams.

Dominic Bernard Patrick Luke Monaghan (born December 8, 1976) is an English actor. He is well-known for playing Merry Brandybuck in Peter Jackson's film trilogy of J. R. R. Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings". He is also well-known for playing Charlie Pace on the television show "Lost".

Dominic has a tattoo on his right arm of the Elvish word for "nine". It means that his character was one of the nine members of the Fellowship of the Ring in "The Lord of the Rings". Many other cast members also got similar tattoos during the making of the movie. On his left arm is a tattoo that says "Living is easy with eyes closed", a line from The Beatles' song "Strawberry Fields Forever". On "Lost", Charlie's tape/bandage finger-rings with letters spelling out words were Monaghan's idea. He thought that because Charlie is an artist, he would still want to be creative even when trapped on an island. Monaghan also actually plays the guitar on "Lost".
Dominic dated Evangeline Lilly while the two of them were on "Lost". The two broke up in 2007.

A logo is a picture or drawing that is used by a person, group, or company to mark who they are.
A company or group can use a 'logo' on the things that they make, like on the things they sell, on letters, and in advertisements. When another person sees the logo picture, that person knows that the thing they see the logo on came from that company.
Logos can have letters and words in them. Many logos have the name of the company or group in them.
Most logos are very simple drawings with only a small number of colors. Some logos are only black and white.
In many countries, companies and groups should tell their country's government about the logo they are using. If they do this, the government can help stop a different company or group from using the same logo, so that everyone can be sure that the logo is only used by the people who used it first. This is sometimes called a 'trade mark'.
Logos are not used only by companies. Many schools have logos. Some cities have logos. Clubs can have logos. Even people can have their own logos if they want, the heraldic badge is probably the oldest form of logo in the world.

The hermit crab is a type of crab that doesn't have a very hard shell. Not a true crab, it uses other animals' old shells for protection; they especially like old whelk shells. As the hermit crab grows in size, it must find a larger shell.

The hermit crab is a crustacean; there are about 500 different species of hermit crabs around the world. Most hermit crab species live on the ocean floor, but many live on land. Female terrestrial (land based) hermit crabs must return to the sea to breed.

Hermit crabs are omnivores (eating plants and animals) and scavengers (eating dead animals that they find). They eat worms, plankton, and organic debris.

A molecule is the smallest amount of a chemical substance that can exist. If a molecule were split into smaller pieces, it would be a different substance.
Molecules are made up of atoms that are stuck together in a particular shape. Not all combinations of atoms are possible; atoms like certain shapes, but not others. For example, oxygen atoms always have two bonds with other atoms, carbon atoms always have four bonds with other atoms, and nitrogen atoms always have three bonds with other atoms.
In gases like air, the molecules are just flying around. In liquids like water, the molecules are stuck together but they can still move. In solids like sugar, the molecules can only vibrate.
With a molecular formula, you can write down the numbers of all atoms in a molecule. For example, the molecular formula of sugar is C6H12O6. That means that one molecule of sugar is made up of six carbon atoms, twelve hydrogen atoms and six oxygen atoms.

Lanark is a town in South Lanarkshire, Scotland. It is close to Carluke and biggar. Lanark is aproximately 40 miles from Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland. William Wallace once lived there. There is a statue of Wallace on the town church. A plaque remembers where he "first drew sword to free his native land" in 1296, when he killed Heselrig, the English sheriff of Lanark. This event forms the start of the Mel Gibson film, "Braveheart".
Lanark is also notable for its annual Lanimer celebrations, where local children on coloured floats parade through the streets along with marching pipe bands. A Lanimer Queen is elected from the children, and crowned in a ceremony at the foot of the High Street. A Lord Cornet is chosen from local businessmen, and acts as escort for the Queen for the events of Lanimer Week.

Quantum entanglement is a term used to describe how two particles act together.

Once two particles meet, they become a system. It is as if a long string is attached between them that can never break. They exist as one although they are two. It's as if they now sit on the same teeter-totter seesaw. No matter how long the seesaw is, even if it is one million miles long, if one end is down the other end must be up, and this happens instantly.

This is not due to one particle sending a message to the other particle saying, "I'm going down, therefore, you must go up" and waiting for the particle to receive the message, but the particles are always connected and do not have to send signals to each other; they are part of the same system and can think as one.

American (or court) handball, usually referred to simply as handball, is an American form of fives played against one or more walls.

It is a common belief that "American handball" was brought to the United States in the 1880s by Irish immigrants. The Gaelic handball sport was played since the 15th century in Ireland and Scotland.

American handball is played on a court 12.2 meters long by 6.1 meters wide (40 feet long by 20 feet wide) with either a single (front) wall, three walls, or in a fully enclosed four-wall court (the most common). The four-wall court is a rectangular box. The front wall is 6.1 meters (20 feet) square, and the side walls are 12.2 meters (40 feet) long and 6.1 meters (20 feet) high. In the middle of the floor of the court lies the short line, that divides the floor into two 6.1 meter (20 feet) squares. Also along the floor is the service line, which is 1.5 meters (5 feet) in front of the short line. The service zone is the area between these two lines. The back wall of the court is usually 3.7 meters (12 feet) high, with an above gallery for the referee and scorer, and also spectators. A few courts have a glass back wall and/or glass side walls to allow for a better view of the match. (In three-wall court handball, the court often has a front wall and two full side walls, or the front wall is flanked by two triangular wings.)

A capacitor (also called condenser, which is the older term) is an electronic device that stores electric energy. It is similar to a battery, but is smaller, lightweight and charges up much quicker. It is used in many electronic devices today.
There are different types of capacitors:Electrolytic, Polyester, MKT, Ceramic, Greencap and Film.
The type used depends on the application. Capacitors come in many sizes. They can be as small as an ant or as large as a soft drink can.
All capacitors have two connections, or leads. While most can be swapped around, some must be used the correct way, or they can violently explode.

The Voyager program is a space exploration program of the United States' NASA agency. It consists of a pair of unmanned scientific probes, "Voyager 1" and "Voyager 2". They were launched in 1977 to take advantage of a favorable planetary alignment of the late 1970s. Although they were officially used to study just Jupiter and Saturn, the two probes were able to continue their mission into the outer solar system. They have since continued out and exited the solar system. These probes were built at JPL and were funded by NASA.
Both missions have gathered large amounts of data about the gas giants of the solar system, of which little was known before. In addition, the spacecraft paths have been used to place limits on the existence of Planet X, a planet believed by some people to be located past Pluto.

A British person or object comes from the United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland), the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands (near France). It can also be used for some overseas places like Gibraltar (near Spain) or the Falkland Islands (near South America).
The term "British" is often used to describe something unique to the UK, for example 'the British way of life' or 'the British weather'. Sometimes it is accidentally used to describe some English, though it is usually over looked because English is British. Britain is not England, though.
A British person can also be called a Briton. A unique symbol of the "British" is the Union Jack flag which is recognised globally as a symbol of the United Kingdom.
Although being British is a collective identity, the countries of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland and the principality of Wales have separate identities and flags which make them unique.

A nuclear power plant is a place where people make electricity using heat from nuclear reactions. A nuclear power plant has a place where the nuclear reaction happens called a reactor. The plant also has machines which remove heat from the reactor and make electricity. Electricity made by nuclear power plants is called nuclear power.
Nuclear power plants use uranium as fuel. When the reactor is on, uranium atoms inside the reactor split into two atoms. When uranium atoms split, they give off a large amount of heat. This splitting of atoms is called fission. Only atoms of uranium and plutonium can fission. Today, fission only happens in nuclear reactors. In nuclear reactors, fission only happens when the reactors parts are arranged properly. Nuclear power plants turn their reactors off to replace old fuel with new fuel.
Uranium atoms are slightly radioactive. The atoms produced when uranium breaks apart are strongly radioactive. These atoms are called fission products. Strontium-90 and cesium-137 are fission products. Old fuel from nuclear power plants is called high level nuclear waste.
Nuclear power plants can be dangerous to live near. If a nuclear power plant has an accident, it can give off radiatioactive smoke. Some famous accidents at nuclear power plants were the Chernobyl accident at Chernobyl in Ukraine, the Three Mile Island accident at Three Mile Island in the United States, and the Windscale fire in Britain.

Driftwood is wood that has been washed onto the shore of a sea, river, or lake by winds, tides, waves or man.
In some waterfront areas, driftwood is a major nuisance. However, the driftwood provides shelter and food for birds, fish and other aquatic species as it floats in the ocean. Gribbles, shipworms and bacteria decompose the wood and gradually turn it into nutrients that are reintroduced to the food web. Sometimes, the partially decomposed wood washes ashore, where it also shelters birds, plants, and other species. Driftwood can become the foundation for sand dunes.

According to Norse mythology, the first humans, Ask and Embla, were formed out of two pieces of driftwood, an ash and an elm, by the god Odin and his brothers, Ve and Vili.
Driftwood carried by Arctic rivers was the main, or sometimes only, source of wood for some Inuit and other Arctic populations living north of the tree-line until they came into regular contact with European traders.
Many people use driftwood as parts of decorative furniture or other art forms, and it is a popular element in the scenery of fish tanks.

At the meeting, he talked with the other animals about the cause of their suffering, Man. He gave them the way to end their problem, rebellion. Later, he told the farm animals about his dream. In the dream he saw the Earth after Man was no longer on it. He also remembered a song sang by the animals of old, "Beasts of England", which the animals learned very fast.
Unfortunately, while the animals were singing "Beasts of England", the sound woke Mr. Jones. He fired his gun six times. This ended the meeting immediately. Old Major died peacefully in his sleep 3 days later.

A clause is a part of a sentence. Each clause has only one main verb. "I love you" is a sentence which has only one clause. "I love you and I will always love you" is a sentence which has two clauses. The two clauses are "I love you" and "I will always love you". These clauses are joined together by the word "and" (a conjunction).
Two clauses can be joined with a pronoun. For example: "I live in London, which is in England". Here, "I live in London" is the first clause, and "which is in England" is the second clause. The word "which" is a pronoun which takes the place of "London". It joins the two clauses.
A sentence can contain many clauses. But sentences with fewer clauses are easier to understand.
A subordinating clause is one which is dependent on the main clause (the primary clause). The main clause makes sense on its own. However, the subordinating clause does not. Eg. "I love you" makes perfect sense left on its own. However, "and always will", does not.

Macro-sociology is a way of looking at the world of people in a broad way. It studies mass of many peoples. It is about "concerned with human societies". Macrosociology is considered one of the main foundations of sociology (contrast with micro-sociology).
In sociology there are different levels of analysis. Macro-sociology is the analysis of either large collectivities (the city, the church) or, more abstractly, of social systems and social structures. (Dictionary of Sociology, 2000)
With the perspective of macro-sociology, it is possible to better understand societies, culture, groups and organizations.

Exponentiation (power) is something which is done on numbers. It is repeated multiplication. People write exponentiation with upper index. This looks like this: formula_1. Sometimes it is not possible. Then people write powers using ^ sign: 2^3 means formula_2.
The number formula_3 is called base, and the number formula_4 is called exponent. For example, in formula_2, 2 is the base and 3 is the exponent.
To calculate formula_2 a person must multiply 3 times the number 2. So formula_7. The result is formula_8. What the equation says can be also said this way: 2 raised to the power of 3 equals 8.
If the exponent is equal to 2, then the power is called square because the area of a square is calculated using formula_12. So
If the exponent is equal to 3, then the power is called cube because the volume of a cube is calculated using formula_15. So
If the exponent is equal to -1 then the person must calculate the inverse of the base. So
If the exponent is equal to formula_20 then the result of exponentiation is the square root of the base. So formula_21
It is possible to calculate exponentiation of matrices. The matrix must be square. For example: formula_36.

Phoebe is a moon which goes around (orbits) the planet called Saturn. It takes eighteen months for Phoebe to go all the way around Saturn. It is half made out of rock, and half made out of ice. The ground on Phoebe is black, which means that it is very dark when seen from Earth. Phoebe does not have any air, and there is no water on its surface. Because there is no air or water, there are no people living there.
There are many craters on Phoebe. These are from asteroids and other things crashing into it, and leaving round marks on the surface.
Phoebe is slightly irregular, which means that it is not spherical, or circular. It has an average diameter of 220 km. This means that Phoebe is about 1/15th the size of Earth's moon.

Cymbospondylus was a large but very primitive Triassic ichthyosaur, with a long eel-like body up to 10 meters or more in length.
Cymbospondylus is known from both Germany and Nevada, and there is no doubt that, like other large marine reptiles and mammals, this animal had a cosmopolitan, pan-oceanic distribution.
Although traditionally included under the Shastasaurid, Cymbospondylus seems to have been more primitive than other members of the family, and probably represents an early but successful offshoot of ichthyosaur evolution.

Their bodies consist of 99% water and they have no bones or inner organs. A jellyfish has a bell-shaped body and long tentacles at the underside of the body. (Tentacles are long "arms" with special stinging cells.) They move by contracting moves of their bell, but they cannot decide where to go on their own. Most time they drift with the water current.
This is why they assemble in swarms. They reproduce without mating by creating polyps, which do not look like jellyfish and are fixed to the ground.
When they turn to 10-15 small jellyfish, they die.
Jellyfish eat plankton and little fish, which are caught by their poisoned tentacles.
Some jellyfish live in symbiosis with algae. The jellyfish transport them into sunlight and get the nutrients (of their photosynthesis) from them. The largest species is the Portuguese Man o' War.

The cytosol (cf. "cytoplasm", which also includes the organelles) is the internal fluid of the cell, and a part of cell metabolism occurs here.
Proteins within the cytosol play an important role in signal transduction pathways and glycolysis.
Cytosol mostly consists of water, dissolved ions, small molecules, and large water-soluble molecules (such as protein). It contains about 20% to 30% protein.
Normal human cytosolic pH is (roughly) 7.0 (i.e. neutral), whereas the pH of the extracellular fluid is 7.4.

Abbey Road Studios, usually called just "Abbey Road", are the recording studios located inside EMI's headquarters in St. John's Wood, London, England.
Abbey Road had three different studios for most of its history. Other space was turned into a fourth studio later. Studio One is large, and used to be a ballroom. Symphony orchestras and very large bands and groups are recorded there. Studio Two is smaller, and works best for small combos or groups of musicians. Studio Three is much smaller, and is meant for soloists and duos. Studio Four is mostly for post-production, where changes are made to earlier recordings.
The studios are famous for the many great and popular songs and albums recorded there. The Beatles are the most famous recording artists to work at Abbey Road. They made the studios well-known when they talked to the media, about the music they made there. The Beatles even titled their last album "Abbey Road", after the studio location. They mostly recorded in Studio Two, but used One and Three also.

Auckland is the largest city in New Zealand. The Auckland region has a population of about 1.4 million people. For a brief period in New Zealand's history it was the capital city; however that was moved to Wellington.
Auckland is situated on two magnificent harbours. It is known as the "City of Sails" and the nearby Hauraki Gulf is dotted with a variety of islands and provides safe anchorage and interesting sailing.
Auckland is built on a series of dormant volcanos. The youngest and largest of these is called Rangitoto, an island just a few kilometres from the City centre. It is lush with pohutakawas, native trees also known as the New Zealand Christmas tree because of their brilliant red flowers which bloom in December.

An organ trio is a type of jazz band with three musicians. Usually a jazz organ trio consists of a Hammond organ player, a drummer, and either a jazz guitarist or a saxophone player.
Organ trios popular in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s. Organ trios usually performed jazz music that had influences from blues music. Organ trios are usually led by the organ player, who is called the leader of the trio.

Important organ trio leaders from the 1950s were organists such as Jimmy McGriff, Jimmy Smith, and Jack McDuff. In the late 1960s, organist Larry Young had a jazz fusion style organ trio. In the 1970s, Tony Williams had a jazz fusion band called "Lifetime" which was an organ trio. In the 1990s and 2000s, organist Joey DeFrancesco is an organ trio leader.

The word "organ trio" is also used to refer to the type (or "genre") of music played by organ trios from the 1950s and 1960s. For example, a person might say "I want to listen to some organ trio music." This would usually mean that they want to listen to music by Jimmy McGriff, Jimmy Smith, Jack McDuff, or other well-known organ trio leaders.

Conceived by Oliver Bulleid for the Southern Railway's Dartford commuter route, the two 4DD electric multiple units were the only double-deck trains to run on the main line railway network in Britain. The upper-level seats were squeezed in between the lower-level seats to ensure that the overall height of the unit was within the clearances necessary to pass through tunnels and under bridges. The 4DD was somewhat unsuccessful because the upper level compartments were cramped and poorly ventilated (the upper level windows could not be opened due to tight clearance). The compartments were pressure-ventilated but the equipment proved to be troublesome. Also dwell times at stations were increased because of the increased number of passengers per door. To obtain the extra seating capacity that was being sought, it was instead decided to lengthen trains from eight cars to ten.

Volterra is a city in the Tuscany region of Italy. The city is in the province of Pisa.

The city was a Neolithic settlement and an important Etruscan center. It became a "municipium" (a type of Roman city) in the Roman Age. Volterra was attacked and controlled by Florence many time. When the Florentian Republic fell in 1530, Volterra came under the control of the Medici family. It later became part of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany.

The Medici Villa di Spedaletto is located outside the city in direction of Lajatico. Also near the city, in the Valle Bona area, are excavations of Etruscan tombs.

Volterra is an important location in Stephenie Meyer's popular book, "New Moon". In the story, Volterra is home to the Volturi, a type of royal family of vampires.

The Belgian Grand Prix is an automobile race, part of the Formula One World Championship.
The first national race of Belgium was held in 1925 at the Spa region's race course, an area of the country that had been associated with motor sport since the very early years of racing before the turn of the century. To accommodate Grand Prix motor racing, the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps race course was built in 1921 but it was only used for motorcycle racing until 1924. After the 1923 success of the new 24 hours of Le Mans in France, the Spa 24 Hours, a similar 24 hour endurance race, was run at the Spa track.

The Flesch-Kincaid Reading level measures textual difficulty and tells you the grade level of a text.
The Flesch-Kincaid index tells how easy something is to read. It does this by counting the number of syllables in every word and the number of words in every sentence. Then some math is done. The number will represent a grade-school level. For example, a sentence with a score of 8.0 means that someone in 8th grade could understand it. Normal writing is usually between 7 and 8.
0.39 x Average No. of words in sentences + 11.8 x Average No. of syllables per word - 15.59

Saint Joseph, it says in the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke, was engaged to a young woman named Mary.
The Gospel of Luke says that at this time, the angel Gabriel came to Mary to tell her that she would give birth to a Son and she should call him Jesus and that he would save people from their sins. Mary said "How can this happen? I am a virgin!" The angel said "With God, anything can happen!"
When Joseph found out that Mary was pregnant, he decided to privately break the engagement. But then he had a dream. An angel told him that the baby was "the Son of God".
At this time, the Roman Emperor, Caesar Augustus, made a law that everyone in the Roman Empire must pay tax. Everyone had to go back to the town that their family came from, to have their name put on the tax lists. Joseph came from Bethlehem, which was called "The City of David". Joseph took Mary to Bethlehem and she gave birth to the baby, Jesus, in a stable, because there was no room for them.

Pearl Harbor is a naval base in the U.S. state of Hawaii, on the island of Oahu. Using this base, the U.S was able to have a good position on the advancing Japanese fleet. However, the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, on December 7, 1941, which was a surprise. The attack led to America's fighting in World War II.
World War II was a war fought between the Allies and the Axis Powers. It was called a "World War" because many countries all over the world fought or helped in this war. Of all the wars ever fought, World War II involved the most countries and killed the most people. About 72 million people died, making it the worst man made disaster of all time. It lasted six years in Europe, from 1939 to 1945.

Sigmund Freud (May 6, 1856 - September 23, 1939) was an Austrian neurologist (a person who treats sicknesses of the nervous system) and famous psychologist. Many people call him "the father of psychoanalysis."
He was born as Sigismund Schlomo Freud, but in 1877 at the age of 21 he changed his name to Sigmund Freud.
Freud is important in psychology because he was the first person to study the unconscious scientifically. The unconscious is a part of a person's mind which he does not know is thinking, and he cannot control it easily. Many people did not like this idea, and many people did not like Freud because he said people had hidden thoughts that they didn't know about.
After Freud wrote his first book, he got married, to Martha Belnays. They had six children, and the youngest (Anna Freud) became another famous psychologist.
Freud thought sex was the most important need for human beings after staying alive. He called this need the libido. He thought that sometimes people would do something they did not really want to do because the libido made them do it.
Freud lived in Germany in the 1930s. Because he was Jewish, Hitler did not like him. He made people burn Freud's books in public. Some of the Nazis wanted to hurt Freud. Because Freud and his family did not feel safe anymore, they left Vienna and went to England in June 1938.

The World Wide Web ("WWW" or "The Web") is the part of the Internet that contains websites and webpages. It was invented in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland. Sir Tim Berners-Lee created a new language called HTML. Websites are composed of pages linked by hypertext links. They are all written in HTML.
The World Wide Web is not used to describe HTML webpages that are not part of the Internet.
In order to see the World Wide Web one needs a computer and a computer program called a web browser. Many websites nowadays offer free websites allowing one to make websites that can be displayed on the WWW like any other domain (www.domain-name.com) site. These sites make money from advertisements instead of fees.
One thing about "WWW" is that it takes longer to say it out "double-you, double-you, double-you" than just simply saying "World Wide Web". It acts as a abbreviation only when you write it out. Some people just say "triple double-you".

A Time server is a special computer in a Computer network.
It is important that computer on a network have a common idea of time. Time servers are computers with special software on them. They either use an atomic clock, or they ask other computers on the network about the time. They then make this time available to all the other computers in the same network. Common protocols used to do this are the DAYTIME protocol and the Network Time Protocol (NTP).
Dedicated Time Server [NTP] delivers the time directly into LAN network using NTP and SNTP protocols. It is equipped with multiple independent Ethernet interfaces. UTC reference time is drawn simultaneously from different clocks via GPS or RF AM. It has build-in oscillators (rubidium, ocxo, tcxo) stabilized in PLL/FLL against 1PPS frequency reference. This device is ready for continuous operation 24h/ day and is able to provide simultaneous synchronization to 10 000 NTP clients: servers, routers and workstations.

Metis is the goddess of wisdom in Greek mythology. She is one of the Titans and is the daughter of Oceanus and Tethys. She was the mother of Athena.

Athena's Birth.
There are many stories about Athena's birth. In Hesiod's "Theogony", Zeus had sex with Metis, but was then scared of her having a child becase a prophecy had said that Metis would have children who were more powerful then Zeus. To try and stop Metis having a child, Zeus changed her into a fly and then swollowed her. However, Zeus was too late and Metis was already pregnant.
When she was inside Zeus, Metis made a helmet and a robe for her baby. The hammering noise caused Zeus to have a headache. To try and help Zeus with the pain, Prometheus, Hephaestus, Hermes, or Palaemon (depending on the myth) cut his head open with a Minoan axe. Athena then came out of Zeus's head. She was fully grown and had her armour on.

Mugello is a landscape north of Florence in northern Italy. It is separated by the Santerno River's valley by the Futa Pass.
In ancient times it was on the border between the area settled by the Ligurians (the Magelli tribe, whence the name), the Etruscans and the Gauls. The Roman colonization left sparse traces, as the Mugello was mostly an agricultural area. In the Middle Ages it was home to numerous castles, and was later acquired by the Republic of Florence. Several families of the city built there partician villas, like those of the Medici in Cafaggiolo and the Trebbio. Recent is the creation of the artificial Lake of Bilancino on the Sieve (river) river.
The area gave name to the Mugello Circuit (Autodromo Internazionale del Mugello) which is a race track that hosts an annual Moto GP event.

The bladder is an organ in the human body. All the liquids that are drunk go through the bladder. The bladder takes in the liquid in order for the body to work. The bladder works with the kidneys. The kidneys clean the liquid we drink. This goes on till the bladder is too full to hold any more. The bladder then tells the brain that it needs to be emptied. Once this message is received to the brain, the muscles around the bladder start to squeeze and the bladder starts to contract. At the same time the bladder sends a message to other muscles (pelvic floor muscles) to relax and let the liquid pass.

A weather front is a boundary in between two masses of air of different densities, and is the principal cause of significant weather. In surface weather analyses, fronts are depicted using various colored lines and symbols. The air masses separated by a front usually differ in temperature and humidity.
Cold fronts may feature narrow bands of thunderstorms and severe weather, and may on occasion be preceded by squall lines or dry lines. Warm fronts are usually preceded by stratiform precipitation and fog. The weather usually quickly clears after a front passes. Some fronts produce no precipitation and little cloudiness, although there is invariably a wind shift.

A countertenor is a male singer who uses a falsetto voice to sing high notes like a female contralto or mezzo-soprano.
Countertenors were used a lot in the Renaissance and Baroque periods when females were not allowed to sing in church choirs. They did not have big, dramatic voices like castrati, so they were not normally used in opera. People forgot about this way of singing in the 18th and 19th centuries, although male altos continued to sing in English cathedral and church choirs. In the 20th century an English countertenor called Alfred Deller became very famous. He sang many songs from the Baroque period that had been written for the countertenor voice, for example songs by Henry Purcell who sang countertenor himself. Today there is a lot of interest again in using this type of voice for performing early music like Renaissance and Baroque music.

Lightning is a powerful electrical discharge produced during a thunderstorm. The electric current is very hot and causes the air around it to expand very quickly, which in turn makes thunder. Sometimes it happens between clouds. Sometimes (in the rain) it goes from cloud to ground. If it goes from cloud to ground, it can strike a person. Around 2000 people are struck by lightning each year.
Benjamin Franklin was fascinated by lightning and its properties. His curiosity led to many important discoveries.
Lightning is caused by static charges mainly positive and negative opposite charges coming and repelling each other.

Alphabetical order is a way to sort (organize) a list. It makes it easier to find a name or a title in the list. It is done by following the standard (usual) order of letters in an alphabet. Sorting things in English is done using the Roman alphabet. Different languages have different rules for sorting.
If many words have the same first letter, they are sorted by their second letters.
After that, the third and fourth letters are used until the whole list is sorted.
The words a, an and the are ignored. Sometimes they are written at the end, after a comma. Spaces and hyphens (-) are ignored, too.
Names are usually ordered by Family name, not given name.
Names are often written with the last names first.
Numbers can be sorted in two ways. Sometimes, they are listed in order from smallest to largest. This is the normal way to sort numbers.
Other times, they can be sorted as if they were normal, spelled-out words. This way is often used for numbers in titles.

Flammability or inflammability means that something can be set on fire easily. It will burn easily. The words come from Latin. The word at the base is "in-flammare" (late Latin). It means something like "to put fire to a thing".
"Inflammable" and "flammable" are used to mean the same thing. People sometimes get confused and think that "inflammable" means "not flammable" because the prefix "in" is often used to mean "not". For example, something that is inhuman is not human. Since many people do not know that "inflammable" means "burns easily", "flammable" is used more often in public places as a warning.

Evil means anything which is bad or wrong. It is the opposite of good. People usually say that an action which hurts people or breaks certain rules is evil. However, a person or a group that does evil things can also be called evil.
In theology, there is a big question: "If there is a God, why does God let evil happen?" Some think that evil proves that there is not a God. Others think that God lets evil happen so that people can choose "not" to do evil.
The study of good and evil in philosophy is called ethics. Ethics tries to explain why some actions are good and other actions are evil. It gives all kinds of answers for how to tell evil from good.

Bedouin people live in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East. They call themselves "people of the tent".
This is because they are "nomadic", which means they do not live in houses but travel around, living in tents. Bedouin were always camel raisers and drivers, sheep and goat nomads, cattle driving nomads, merchants. Today many Bedouin have given up the nomadic life and live and work in towns. But most do not forget that they are bedouin, and are proud of their heritage.
For example, the actor Nadim Sawalha is proud of not knowing his exact date of birth because he was born when his family were nomadic bedouin. He is equally proud of the pioneering work his family did in the hotel and tourism industry when they settled in town in Jordan.

ELISPOT stands for "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Spot Assay." This is a laboratory technique for detecting biological cells that generate (or "secrete") various substances. These substances can include specific types of cytokines or antibodies. The ELISPOT method is typically used with blood cells, and is a helpful tool in studying the human immune system and various treatments for disease (e.g. vaccines).
In the ELISPOT technique, tiny wells are used to contain the cells, along with a variety of other substances. The substances cause colored spots to form in the vicinity of the cells that secrete the substances in question. These spots can then be counted manually (using a microscope, for example) or automatically using specialized equipment with computer vision capabilities.
The ELISPOT technique is very sensitive, and can detect even a single substance-producing cell. It is also very versatile, since it can be tailored to detect a wide variety of very specific secretions.

Concubinage is the state of a woman in a relationship with a man of higher social status that gives her less rights than a marriage. In most of the cases the man has an official wife and one or more concubines. Concubines have only limited rights of support from the man, and their children have lower status than children born by the official wife or wives; these legal rights distinguish a concubine from a mistress.
Historically, the the family of a girl were in favour of a concubinage with an mighty man, as it meant economic security for the woman. But concubinage could also mean sexual slavery of one member of the relationship, typically the woman, who was a pleasure slave to the man.
In the Western world there is no legal status of concubines, as only monogamous marriages are allowed. Any other relationship does not enjoy legal protection; the woman is necessarily a mistress.

The F-15 Eagle is a fighter jet that originally made by McDonnell-Douglas (later Boeing). It is known around the world for its toughness and "undefeated" record, meaning that it has never been shot down by an enemy plane. It is used primarily by the United States Air Force, but it is also used in Israel, Saudi Arabia and South Korea. It carries missiles to shoot down, or kill enemy fighter jet planes.

In 1981, the F-15 was redesigned to include the ability to carry bombs, allowing the F-15 to assume a ground-attack role, as well. This means that in addition to shooting down other planes, it can kill buildings on the ground. This new variant (design) of the aircraft was called the " F-15E Strike Eagle".

The Flag of Denmark, the "Dannebrog" is red with a white Scandinavian cross. It is the oldest flag in the entire world.
The flag is supposed to have fallen from the sky during a battle in 1219 in Estonia. The Danes were about to loose the battle when this sign from above gave the warriors new energy, and made them win.
In reality the Dannebrog of 1219 was most likely a crusade banner - the war in 1219 was a crusade against the Estonians, who were not Christians.
The battle took place in the 15th of June, and every year the flags birthday is celebrated in this day.
In some countries the flag is a symbol of the state. In Denmark the Dannebrog is very much a symbol of the people, and the flag is used for all kinds off private celebrations - such as birthdays, weddings and christmas. For Danes the Dannebrog is a sign of happiness.

A MiniDisc is a small magneto-optical disk. It is used as a replacement for the Audio cassette. It was developed by Sony to store music. Later it was modified, so it can also store data. The music it stores is compressed in some way, like an MP3. Recent Hi-MD models have the option to not compress audio, and offer audio identical to CD-quality.
MiniDisc recorders allow the user to modify the contents of (recordable) disks. That way, tracks can be split, combined or rearranged. Audio tracks can be input while a live recording is in progress, too, for example, while recording a live concert or interview via the microphone input on a MiniDisc recorder.

Class 157 was the designation applied to a range of Diesel multiple unit trains of the Sprinter family planned for regional use, in particular for the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive. As well as the class number, British Rail reserved carriage numbers in the 526xx and 576xx series for these units.
Unfortunately, as the Privatisation of British Rail began, this project became unviable as resources were concentrated on the privatisation process, leading to the famous 1064-day 'drought' of new train orders. By the time this period was over, plans had moved on and Stratchclyde ended up receiving a batch of Class 170 units.

William Wallace was a knight from Scotland who fought the King of England (Edward I) in the Middle Ages. He was born around 1270, and executed by the English on 23 August 1305. Scotland had been occupied by England, and Wallace led resistance to the occupation. A book called "The Acts and Deeds of Sir William Wallace, Knight of Elderslie" was written by a minstrel named Blind Harry in the 15th century. The book is written more like a story than a true version of his life, and has led to much of the legends around William Wallace. The film Braveheart is based on the novel.

Exactly where and when Wallace was born is not very clear. Some people say he was born about 1272, but a book printed in the 16th century called "History of William Wallace and Scottish Affairs" says he was born in 1276. Tradition says he was born in Elderslie, near Paisley in Renfrewshire. There are links with Ayrshire as well, and it is not clear whether Wallace first fought the English in Ayrshire or Lanark.

Tradition sees Wallace as a "common", normal person. Robert the Bruce, who also fought the English, was seen as being more noble. But this is not true because Wallace's family were minor nobles.

Snakes are reptiles. They do not have legs. Snakes are known to eat small animals, for example mice and birds. Some snakes are venomous - their bite can be toxic (the toxin goes through their teeth), or they can spit venom. Some snakes like the Rubber boa or the Sand boa are small but some types like the Green Anaconda or Reticulated Python can be very large. Some snakes, like the King Cobra, are venomous, but some are not. They move by pushing and pulling themselves with the muscles on the bottom of their bodies. They swallow their food whole, sometimes by dislocating their jaws. Once the snake's prey is in its body, its internal muscles crush it so the animal can be digested. They are cold-blooded carnivores and some eat large prey. They feed on rodents and mice. They capture prey in many ways. Some snakes are big enough to kill a full grown person, but this is rare.

The word "vegetable" can also be used to mean plants in general, such as when people say "Animal, Vegetable, or Mineral."
However, in an Asian context, 'vegetable' may mean any plant produce, apart from grain and nuts, that is consumed cooked, while only the fruits consumed raw are considered as 'fruits' in that sense. For example, a pumpkin is therefore considered a vegetable, while a melon qualifies as a fruit.

In music, a melisma is the technique of singing one syllable to a lot of notes. They are often called vocal runs or simply runs. Music which uses melismas can be called melismatic.
In Western music melismas are often used in operas or any other music which is written for the singer to show off the voice. Melismatic music is the opposite of music where each syllable has its own note. In the "Alleluia Chorus" from Handel's "Messiah" each syllable of the word "Alleluya" has its own note. But in other parts of the "Messiah" there are often melismas, e.g. in "Thus saith the Lord" the word "shake" ("and I will shake the heavens and the earth") is set to a run of 25 fast notes. This example can also be described as "word painting". Handel uses the melisma to make it sound like someone shaking something.
Melismas are used a lot in music from many different cultures.

Professor John Cromwell Mather Virginia is an American astrophysicist and cosmologist who was born on August 7, 1946, Roanoke. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2006 for his work on COBE satellite with George Smoot. The COBE satellite measures black holes and cosmic radiation.
This work supported the big-bang theory of the universe beginning and made cosmology much more accurate. The Nobel Prize committee said: "the COBE-project can also be regarded as the starting point for cosmology
Mather is a Senior Astrophysicist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland and he is a professor of physics at the University of Maryland, College Park. In 2007, Mather was listed in "Time" magazine's 100 Most Influential People in The World.

After being awarded his Ph.D. Professor Mather went to work at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at Columbia University, he started the work on COBE (1974-1976). More than 1,000 researchers, engineers and other workers made the COBE satellite. John Mather was in control of them all and created the technology for measuring the cosmic radiation. George Smoot had the job of measuring small changes in the temperature of the radiation.
Professor Mather and John Boslough wrote all about the COBE teams work in a book called "The Very First Light".

The Force is a term from the "Star Wars" universe. It is a set of mystical powers that all the Jedi and Sith have. They can do many things with the Force, such as lifting an object up without touching it, shooting lightning out of their hands, choking people and many other things.

There are two sides to the Force: the light (or good) side and the dark (or bad) side.

The light side is used for good things like healing. The people who study and learn the light side of the Force are called "Jedi".

The dark side of the Force is used by the Sith, the bad guys, in the "Star Wars" movies. Sith have a lot of anger, fear, love and aggression. The dark side of the Force gives the bad guys powers that the Jedi, the good guys, do not have. For example, Darth Sidious is able to shoot lightning from his fingers. The dark side can seem stronger but that is just because a person who uses the dark side of the Force does not have to hold anything back, he is not restrained.

Leptictidium (meaning delicate weasel) was a genus of small prehistoric eutherian from Eocene period. this extinct species of mammal lived alongside the dinosaurs, but died out when the tropical forests opened up.
Leptictidium had long hind legs, and probably used only those two legs when moving fast. Whether it hopped on two legs or ran bipedally is still a matter of debate. It had a long, bare tail which acted as a counterbalance, and a long, mobile snout to help it find its prey.
The leptictids were found right across Eurasia. Leptictidium itself was a specialised hopper with the best preserved specimens found in the Messel shales of Germany.

Falun Gong (also known as Falun Dafa) is a spiritual discipline from China. It was founded by Li Hongzhi in 1992. People who follow Falun Gong do five exercises and read books written by Li Hongzhi. They believe in "Truthfulness, Compassion and Forbearance", and they also believe that the Falun Gong exercises can make them healthy, and better people. There were almost 70 million Falun Gong practitioners in China, according to the government.
In 1999, after a big Falun Gong gathering in front of a Chinese government building, the Communist Party of China said: people cannot practice Falun Gong, it is "illegal." The police started putting Falun Gong followers into jails and labour camps, and torturing them. Over 3000 people who practice Falun Gong have been jailed and tortured to death. This is because the Communist party did not want so many people believing in Falun Gong, which is a non-communist belief system; they thought that Falun Gong was more popular than they were. Many people and groups outside of China have said that the Communist Party should stop jailing and killing Falun Gong people.
It is not known how many people pracise Falun Gong: The Chinese government suggests there were 70 million practitioners in China in 1998. In one article, Falun Gong's Clearwisdom.net says there are 100 million practitioners in more than 80 countries.

The Israel-West-Bank barrier is a wall being built the State of Israel to separate the West Bank of the Jordan River from Israel. As of 2007, the wall is currently being built. Some who oppose the building of the wall call it the Apartheid Wall, likening the border with the apartheid system that ruled South Africa (see global apartheid). The problem with this is that so far, the borders between Israel and the Palestinian Territories have not been agreed upon. Israel has built the barrier without consensus and against international law. The fence therefore only takes into account what Israel sees as these borders. This will make talks about the borders more difficult.
Very often, the fence or wall has been compared to the Berlin Wall, which divided Berlin in the time where there were two states of Germany, East Germany and West Germany.

Orange is a color. It is the combination of red and yellow.
Orange is the color of an orange fruit, which is the origin of the name of the color. Before the orange fruit was introduced to England in the 1500s, this color was called "red-yellow".

To the human eye, orange is a very "hot" color, so it gives the sensation of heat. Nevertheless, orange is not as aggressive as red. Orange increases oxygen supply to the brain, produces an invigorating effect, and stimulates mental activity. As a citrus color, orange is associated with healthy food and stimulates appetite. Orange is the color of fall and harvest. In heraldry, orange is symbolic of strength and endurance. Orange is also the color of the fruit of the same name.
Orange has very high visibility, so people can use it to catch attention and highlight the most important elements of their design. Orange is very effective for promoting food products and toys. On road signs, the color orange means there is construction work ahead. It is used for these signs because it can easily be seen even at night.
Dark orange can mean deceit and distrust. Red-orange corresponds to desire, sexual passion, pleasure, domination, aggression, and thirst for action. Gold evokes the feeling of prestige. The meaning of gold is illumination, wisdom, and wealth. Gold often symbolizes high quality.

When talking about geography the elevation of a certain point is how high it is compared to some reference point. Very often, the reference point is mean sea level, the level of the ocean midway between high and low tide on an average day.
Sometimes elevation is measured against the center of the earth. The problem there is that the earth does not really look like a ball, it looks more like a potato. This means, that while still at mean sea level (at the equator), some points are father away from the center of the earth than others. That way the peak of Chimborazo, a volcano in Ecuador is further away from the center of the earth than the peak of Mount Everest. Yet, Mount Everest is higher above sea level.

In cryptography, a shared secret is a piece of data only known to the parties involved in a secure communication. The shared secret can be a password, a passphrase, a big number or an array of randomly chosen bytes.
The shared secret is either shared before parties start to communicate; in this case it can also be called a pre-shared key. Or it is created at the start of the communication session by using a key-agreement protocol, for-instance using public-key cryptography such as Diffie-Hellman or using symmetric-key cryptography such as Kerberos.
The shared secret can be used for authentication (for instance when logging in to a remote system) using methods such as challenge-response or it can be fed to a key derivation function to produce one or more keys to use for encryption and/or MACing of messages.
To make unique session and message keys the shared secret is usually combined with an initialization vector (IV). An example of this is the derived unique key per transaction method.

Thyroid cancer is cancer of the thyroid gland. There are four forms: papillary, follicular, medullary and anaplastic. The most common forms (papillary and follicular) are slow growing and may happen again but patients under 45 rarely die from it, and the medullary form also has a good prognosis if it only grows in the thyroid gland and a poorer prognosis if it has spread; the anaplastic form is fast-growing and responds poorly to therapy.
Thyroid nodules are diagnosed by ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (USG/FNA) or frequently by thyroidectomy (surgical removal and subsequent pathological examination). As the thyroid cancer can uptake iodine, radioactive iodine is a commonly used modality in thyroid carcinomas. However, it is followed by TSH suppression by Thyroxine therapy.

Deconstruction is a way to understand books, poems and other writing. It looks at the ways in which words always imply things the author doesn't mean.
One thing it pays attention to is how opposites work. (It calls them "binary oppositions.") It says that two opposites like "good" and "bad" aren't really different things. "Good" only makes sense when someone compares it to "bad," and "bad" only makes sense when someone compares it to "good." And so even when someone talks about "good," they're still talking about "bad."
Because of things like this, deconstruction argues that books and poems never just mean what they're supposed to. Other meanings are always there too, and the book or poem works because all of those meanings work together.

It was started by Jacques Derrida in the 1960s. Other important people who talked about it include Paul de Man.

In fluid dynamics, the baroclinity (sometimes called baroclinicity) is a measure of the stratification in a fluid. A baroclinic atmosphere is one for which the density depends on both the temperature and the pressure; contrast this with barotropic atmosphere, for which the density depends only on the pressure. In atmospheric terms, the barotropic zones of the Earth are generally found in the central lattitudes, or tropics, whereas the baroclinic areas are generally found in the mid-lattitude/polar regions.

South Cadbury is an archaeological site in south Somerset.
It was dug in the early 1970s, and it showed many times that people lived there. The first was in the early Neolithic (around 4000-3000 BC?) when the hill seems to have been an important place for groups of early farmers who moved around. Most things were found from when late Bronze Age people lived on the hill (around 1200 BC). In the Iron Age the site changed, with many big walls. There are signs that when the Romans came to Britain, they killed many people here. Ruins of a feasting hall built after the Roman time were also found in the dig. There are also legends connecting this place with King Arthur.

Catalonia (Catalunya) is a part of Spain placed on north-east, recognized as an "Autonomous Community". Over 7 million people live in the region. In Catalonia people speak their own language, Catalan, but also Spanish. The capital is Barcelona. This city is on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea and is very popular with tourists. The Olympic Games were there in 1992. There are four regions in Catalonia (Barcelona, wich it has the capital, Tarragona, Girona and Lleida).
The people of Catalonia have autonomy in Spain. This means they have their own local government, their own police and some control over their own community. In September 2005, the Catalan Parliament decided to call Catalonia a 'nation' according to Spanish Constitution which says that Spain is a group of nationalities. But this term has no judicial valor and it's only a term to calm down a minority of separatists.
Catalonia is richer than many other Spanish regions, because industrialization began there earlier than in other Spanish areas. However, this relative richness is used by the Spanish state to subsidize other Spanish areas. There are a lot of factories and businesses in the cities. The region is also greener than southern Spain, and crops are grown here. The north of Catalonia is less hot than the rest of Spain, and has more hills and trees. In the north of the region is the border with France.

Aesthetics is a branch of Philosophy. It is the Philosophy of Art and Beauty. Together with ethics it is part of axiology which is the philosophy of what people like.
Aesthetic philosophers ask what people like to look at, hear, feel, smell or taste, and why they like these things. Aesthetic philosophers also ask if art has any value. For example they may ask if some art that nobody likes and that nobody wants is art at all, or if it is something else.
One theory in Aesthetics is called subjectivism. Subjectivism says that something is beautiful to me if I say it is beautiful. Subjectivism also says that something is art for me if I say it is art. Many Aesthetic philosophers do not like subjectivism. They say that art and beauty are to do with an object, not with the person who sees, hears, feels, tastes or smells that object.
Plato, Aristotle and Immanuel Kant are some important philosophers of aesthetics.

Imbolc is a festival belonging to Brigid, the Celtic goddess who, in later times, became famous as a Christian saint. At first, her festival on February 1 was known as "Imbolc" or "Oimelc", two Gaelic names which refer to the lactation of the ewes. Lactation is the flow of milk that happens when the baby lambs are born in the spring, and Gaelic languages are those spoken in countries like Ireland and Scotland.
Imbolc was, and still is, a time to celebrate that winter would soon be over. Sometimes in Ireland, the first flowers are coming up at the time of this festival, even when there is still snow on the ground.
Later, the Roman Catholic Church replaced this festival with Candlemas Day on February 2, a day that now belongs to the Virgin Mary. On this day, people may have ceremonies or processions by candlelight - walking together in the dark, with the only light coming from candles they carry. The may also sing songs to Brigid, or say poems or prayers to her.
In both Pagan and Christian celebrations, Brigid is celebrated as a powerful female figure, who brings light, inspiration, and healing to the world.

A medium is the way or means information is sent or received. Paper is a common "medium", used every day by millions of people. Television is another very common medium; it is said that there is not a community on Earth where at least one family does not own a television. The plural form of "medium" is "media", so radio and television are both types of broadcast media, but paint, charcoal, ink, and clay are types of artistic media. When people buy or sell things, the "medium" is often coins or paper money, but it may also be shells, gems, livestock, or even an agreement to perform a service in the future.
A medium is also a person who it is said can pass messages between the living and the dead. This type of medium was quite popular in the West in the 19th century, but most were found to be dishonest and few remain today. In Taoism, mediums still work. However, the power of mediums is mostly believed by the superstitious.
Medium is also a size, coming between small and large. Other words used in this way include "intermediate", "average", and "middle".

135 film is the official name of the photographic film that is most used today. It is specified by ISO Standard 1007. It was introduced by Kodak in 1934. It was made for making pictures, rather than films. It is 35mm wide; that is why it is often also called 35mm film.
It quickly grew in popularity. It became more popular than 120 film by the late 1960s. Since then, it has been the most popular photographic film format. Despite competition from formats such as 828, 126, 110 and APS, it remains so today.
Individual rolls of 135 film are enclosed in single-spool, light-tight, metal cassettes. This allows cameras to be loaded in daylight. The film is clipped or taped to a spool and exits via a velvet-covered slot. The end of the film is cut on one side to form a leader, which is to be inserted into a corresponding slot in the camera take-up spool. It has the same dimensions and perforation pitch as 35 mm movie print film.

Checkers is the name of several different board games. All of these games are similar. In every kind of checkers, the other player's pieces can be taken by being "jumped" over.
"Checkers" is the American name. In British English, these games are called "draughts"."

Checkers comes from a very old game called Alquerque. Alquerque was played on a different kind of board. Around the 12th century, a French person used a chess board to play Alquerque. This was the first checkers game. Later, maybe in 1535, a new rule was added: when a player can jump, he must jump. This made the game more interesting.

In most games of checkers, there are two players. The players are at opposite ends of the board. One player has dark pieces, and one player has light pieces. They take turns moving their pieces. Players move their pieces diagonally from one square to another square. When a player jumps over their "opponents (the other player's) piece, he takes that piece.

Most English-speaking people call English checkers "checkers." English checkers is played on an 8x8 chess board. Only the dark squares are used (the light squares are never used). For that reason, good players play differently in the left and right corners.

Kinetic energy is the energy which things have because they are moving. So you can think of it as the energy of movement. This energy can be changed into other sorts of energy such as heat (if something hits with something soft and does not bounce), potential energy (if it is moving upwards and gets higher), or even light (if it is moving very, very fast or if it hits something which sparks like flint or iron/Aluminium). However, heat, light, sound, mechanical energy,and other types of energy are also types of kinetic energy.
Meteors, bullets from a gun, and a kicked football all have kinetic energy.

Cave paintings are paintings on cave walls and ceilings. Usually these paintings were made in Prehistoric times. Most cave paintings date from 10.000 to 20.000 years ago. The oldest are from about 32.000 years ago, but scientists still disagree if this dating is correct.
It is not know why these paintings were made. Most people think they may have had a function for rituals. They may also have been a way to transit information; to tell other people about something. Most paintings are in caves that are difficult to access. These caves usually also do not show signs that people lived there all year round.
Today, there are about 350 caves known which have paintings in them. A great number is located in France and Spain. The best known are probably the caves of Altamira (in Spain), Lascaux (in France), or Creswell Crags in England. Sometimes, paintings were also done on cliff faces. Fever of those have survived though, because of erosion. One such example are the rock paintings of Astuvansalmi (in Finland).
Most often, animals or hunting scenes were painted. Sometimes hands are there too. Rarely, there are also more abstract patterns; these are usually called finger fluntings.
The paintings were drawn with red and yellow ochre, hematite, manganese oxide and charcoal. Sometimes the silhouette of the animal was put into the rock first.

The C programming language is a computer programming language that works close to the hardware. It was developed in the 1970s by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie to be used with the UNIX operating system. It is a procedural language, which means that you can divide your program into sub-programs and use these from within the main program.
Because the ideas behind C are kept close to the basic architecture of the computer, the compiler can generate instructions for the computer, that will run very fast. This makes C a good language for writing operating systems, and a lot of them, like Linux and UNIX are mostly made up of C.
Another good thing about C is that it is available for many different platforms. This means, that there are many different compilers to make a C program run on many different processors and operating systems. This is why C is called a "portable" language, because programs written in it can be "ported" to many different platforms.

The following piece of text is an example for source code written in C. When compiled and executed, it will print "Hello world!" on the computer screen and then exit.

The tree-line or timberline is the edge of the habitat at which trees can grow. Beyond the tree-line, they are unable to grow as conditions are too bad.
At the tree-line, tree growth is often not clear with the last trees forming low bushes. If it is caused by wind, these are known as krummholz, from the German for 'twisted wood'.
The tree line, like many other natural lines (lake boundaries, for example), appears well-defined from a distance, but upon close inspection, it is not that clear. Trees grow shorter until they simply stop growing.

In geometry, perimeter is the distance around a flat object. For example, all four sides of a square rhombus have the same length, so a rhombus with side length 2 inches would have a perimeter of 8 inches (2+2+2+2=8).
Real-life objects have perimeters as well. A football field, including the end zones, is 360 feet long and 160 feet wide. So the perimeter of the field is 360+160+360+160=1040 feet.
The perimeter of a circle is usually called the circumference. It may be calculated by multiplying the diameter times "Pi". Pi is a constant which is equal to 3.14159; however, the places to the right of the decimal are endless. The number of places used depend on the accuracy required for the result.

Spache Readability Formula is one method of finding out how hard a piece of writing is (its textual difficulty).
The method compares words in a text to a list of words which are familiar in everyday writing. The words that are not on the list are called "unfamiliar". The number of words per sentence are counted. This number and the percentage of unfamiliar words is put into a formula. The result is a reading age. Someone of this age should be able to read the text.
Spache works best on texts that are for children under the age of eight.
the formula; (0.141 * average sentence length)+(0.086 * percentage of difficult words)+0.839 = grade level
GL = (.121 * ASL) + (.082 *UW) +.659
UW = Number of unique unfamiliar words

If a person has one number "a" and another smaller number "b", he can make the ratio of the two numbers by dividing them. Their ratio is "a"/"b". He can make another ratio by adding the two numbers together "a"+"b" and dividing this by the larger number "a". The new ratio is ("a"+"b")/"a". If these two ratios are equal to the same number, then that number is called the golden ratio. The Greek letter formula_1 (phi) is usually used as the name for the golden ratio.

formula_7 is the number which, when multiplied by itself, makes 5: formula_8.

If the length of a rectangle divided by its width is equal to the golden ratio, then the rectangle is a "golden rectangle". If a square is cut off from one end of a golden rectangle, then the other end is a new golden rectangle. In the picture, the big rectangle (blue and pink together) is a golden rectangle because formula_11. The blue part (B) is a square. The pink part by itself (A) is another golden rectangle because formula_12. The big rectangle and the pink rectangle have the same form, but the pink rectangle is smaller and is turned.

The Fibonacci numbers are a list of numbers. A person can find the next number in the list by adding the last two numbers together. If a person divides a number in the list by the number that came before it, this ratio comes closer and closer to the golden ratio.

There are two types of Japanese traditional dance:"Odori", which was created in the Edo period; and "Mai", which was created in the western part of Japan. Odori came from Kabuki drama, and is more of a male dance. Mai is usually danced by female dancers, and is mostly done at houses, instead of on stage.
A type of the Mai style of Japanese dance is the "Kyomai" or Kyoto Style Dance. Kyomai was created in the 17th century Tokugawa cultural period. It is influenced by the elegance of the manners of the Japanese Imperial Court.

Kilkenny, (), is the county town of County Kilkenny in Ireland. It is situated on both banks of the River Nore, at the centre of County Kilkenny in the province of Leinster in the south-east of Ireland. Kilkenny City is administered by a borough council and has a Mayor. The majority of the population of Kilkenny City live outside the borough boundary. It is the smallest city in the country, with only 25,000 people living here.
From being founded by the church, Kilkenny was the ancient capital of the kingdom of Ossory. The town was established, then a city, in 1609 by royal charter. Kilkenny was the capital of Confederate Ireland between 1642 and 1649. The seat of the Roman Catholic Bishop of Ossory and the Church of Ireland Bishop of Cashel and Ossory are in Kilkenny.
Kilkenny is famous for its medieval building and castle. The town has been referred to as the "Marble City" for centuries. People from Kilkenny are often referred to as 'Cats'.

Communication can be spoken (a word) or non-spoken (a smile). Communication has many ways, and happens all the time. Not only humans communicate, most other animals do too. Some communication is done without thinking, such as by changing in posture

Communication works by exchanging information or messages. In very basic terms
Besides the content of the message, there are other things that are important. These are not part of the message itself, but rather of its context
For a message exchange to be successful, the sender and the recipient must have agreed on a vocabulary. The word "hedge" can mean completely different things based on the context. In biology a hedge is a row of shrubs or trees that make a barrier or form a border. In finance, a hedge is an investment made to reduce therisk of another investment. In linguistics a hedge is a word or set of words that make other words less important. Without any information it is therefore very difficult to know which "hedge" is really meant by the speaker.

Moment of inertia, also called mass moment of inertia, is the rotational analog of mass.
That is, it is the inertia of a rotating body with respect to its rotation. The moment of inertia plays much the same role in rotational dynamics as mass does in basic dynamics. It determines the relationship between angular momentum and angular velocity, torque and angular acceleration.
A simple scalar treatment of the moment of inertia is sufficient for many situations. But with a more advanced tensor treatment it is possible to allow the analysis of such complicated systems as spinning tops and gyroscope motion.
The symbols formula_1 and sometimes formula_2 are usually used to refer to the moment of inertia.

A highly sensitive person (HSP) is a person who is very easily affected by things. They are said to have a 'high sensitivity' (or "innate sensitiveness" as Carl Gustav Jung originally called it).
According to Elaine N. Aron and colleagues as well as other researchers, highly sensitive people, which would represent about a fifth of the population, process sensory data much more deeply and thoroughly due to a biological difference in their nervous systems. This is a specific trait with key consequences that in the past has often been confused with innate shyness, inhibitedness, innate fearfulness, introversion, and so on. The existence of the trait of innate sensitivity was demonstrated using a test that was shown to have both internal and external validity. Although the term is primarily used to describe humans, the trait is present in nearly all higher animals.

A Freegan is a person who does not like to pay for things, but does not steal either. Freegans like to find things that other people throw away that are still useful. People often throw things away that are not used up or broken. Sometimes they throw things away because they are bored of them and like to shop for new things. Freegans look through other people's rubbish bins and take what they can use. This can be good for the environment, because no energy is used to make new things. Unfortunately some cities have rules about taking things out of the rubbish, though, and Freegans get in trouble for this.
The name Freegan rhymes with vegan. It combines the words free and vegan. Freegans are not necessarily vegans.

In chemistry, an alkali is an aqueous (from water) solution with a pH of more than seven.
The word 'Alkali' comes from the Arabic 'qali' meaning 'from the ashes' since ashes mixed with water were used as cleaning products.
An alkali is where a base is dissolved in water. Often it is the salt of an Alkali metal
An alkali is the opposite to an acid and can be neutralised (brought down to pH 7) by adding acid.

The higher the number is over 7 on the pH scale the stronger the alkali is.

Someone can find out how strong or weak and alkali is by adding universal indicator to it. Some universal indicator can be poured into it or use pH paper which is soaked with universal indicator. (i.e- soap and toothpaste are minor-strength alkalis)

Mercury is a chemical element. Its symbol on the periodic table is Hg, and its atomic number is 80. It is a very poisonous silver-colored metallic liquid sometimes used in the manufacture of measuring instruments such as thermometers. It is also known as quicksilver
Before better compounds were discovered, some mercury compounds were used in medicine to kill germs on the skin.
Mercury was known to the ancients and its discoverer is unknown.
It is the only metal, and except for Bromine, the only element known that is liquid under what is known as "normal conditions" (room temperature, normal pressure).
The symbol "Hg" stands for its Latinized Greek name "hydrargyrum", meaning watery or liquid silver. It is very poisonous.

They were different from the American western movies, usually filmed in Italian, had limited budgets, filmed on location in Spain and Italy with minimal sets, and many close-ups and artistic shots. Perhaps the most well-known of these films is "The Man with No Name" trilogy: "A Fistful of Dollars" (1964), "For a Few Dollars More" (1965), and "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" (1966). All three of these films were directed by Sergio Leone, featured music by Ennio Morricone, and starred American actor Clint Eastwood as the main character.

Dachigam National Park is located 22 kilometers from Srinagar (Iqbalabad), the capital city of Indian Occupied Kashmir within the Republic of India. It covers an area of 141 square kilometers. The name of the park literally stands for "ten villages" which could be in memory of the ten villages that were relocated for its formation.
The park has been a protected area since 1910, first under the care of the Maharaja of Kashmir and Jammu and later under the observation of the concerned government authorities. It was initially created to ensure clean drinking water supply for the city of Srinagar. It was finally upgraded and declared a National Park in the year 1981.

Logo is a programming language that is easy to learn. It is used to teach students and children to program a computer. It was developed to process lists of words. It was like the language LISP.
In 1967, the first Logo ran on a mainframe computer, a machine called a teletype was used to type in and printout the results. There was no screen.
In 1969, it was used to control a Floor Turtle. Commands were added to sent the turtle forward and backwards, and to turn the turtle to left or right. This turtle had pen with different colors. When it moved, it left a trail on the floor.
This was very useful. When a new version of Logo was developed to draw graphics on a screen, it used the same commands. This was called Turtle graphics.
There are 170 versions of Logo. Many of them are open source and free. There are three Logo textbooks that can be downloaded free. Logo is usually an interpreted language.

In computing, a serial port is a "serial communication physical interface" through which information transfers, either in or out, one bit at a time (in contrast with parallel port).
During most of the personal computers history, serial ports connected computers to devices such as terminals and various peripherals.
While such interfaces as Ethernet, FireWire, and USB all send data as a serial stream, the term "serial port" usually identifies hardware meeting the requirements of the RS-232 standard, for the purpose of interfacing with a modem or with a similar communication device.
For many computer peripheral devices the USB interface has replaced the serial port. While nearly every server has a serial port, many modern low-end workstations and laptops often don't have one. The serial port is not present for cost savings, and is considered to be a legacy port on personal computers.
However, serial ports can be found in industrial systems, scientific analysis and laboratory equipments, point of sales and some industrial and consumer products. Network equipments (such as routers and switches) often have serial ports for configuration. Serial ports are still used in these areas as they are simple, cheap and allow communications between devices.

William Jefferson Clinton (born August 19, 1946), better known as Bill Clinton, was the 42nd president of the United States. He served from 1993 to 2001. He was 46 years old when he was elected. His major opponents were George H. W. Bush and Bob Dole. Clinton was the first president from the Baby Boom generation and was the third youngest president in the U.S. He is a Democrat. Clinton's supporters say he helped bring the economic boom of the 1990s. His presidency was very controversial to most Republicans, who did not agree with what he did.
Before he was president, Clinton was also governor of Arkansas (1979-1981 and 1983-1993).
In 1994, during Clinton's first term in office, the Congress switched to a Republican majority. However, Clinton still beat Republican Bob Dole in the 1996 election.
President Clinton was accused of wrongdoing by the U.S. House of Representatives in December 1998 during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Although he lied that she did not give him oral sex, he was found to have done nothing wrong by the U.S. Senate in February 1999. The scandal had little effect on his popularity, and he left office with some of the highest approval ratings of any president.
He is married to Senator Hillary Clinton and now lives in New York.

Monstera is a genus of flowering plants. There are about 31 species in the genus. The genus belongs to the family Araceae. Originally, the plants occur in the tropical regions of Central and South America.
The plants are evergreen vines. They climb other trees. They can grow to a height of about 20m. The plants also have aerial roots. These can act as hooks on branches of the tree that the plant is climbing. They can also grow into the ground to support the plant. The leaves are leathery, and dark green. They are special in that they have holes in them. The flowers grow on a special structure called spadix. Some species have edible fruit.
Many people grow some of these species (esp. "Monstera deliciosa") indoors as a houseplant. "Monstera deliciosa" is sometimes also grown for its fruit, which tastes somewhere between a banana and a pineapple.
In some parts of the world (other than Tropical America), some plants started to grow in the wild. This is the case for example in Portugal, on Madeira, Morocco, some parts of India and Malaysia as well as in Florida.

A Vending machine is a automatic machine that sells food such as canned soups and packaged sandwiches, snacks such as potato chips, chocolate bars, and candy); hot drinks (coffee, tea, and hot chocolate); cold drinks (juice, bottled water, soft drinks, and in some cases, milk or chocolate milk); or other items such as newspapers or cigarettes. Vending machines in bathrooms sometimes sell condoms, mouthwash, or toothpaste and toothbrushes.
How do vending machines work?
The machines usually work, when some money (usually coins) is put in a slot. Then, a button needs to be pushed, or a lever pulled. If there is enough money in the machine, the selected item will be dropped to a tray, where it can be taken out by the person making the purchase.

Hippocrates was a Greek doctor. He was probably born in 460 BC, and died in 377 BC.
Hippocrates is called the "father of medicine". He was the first person to write that people got sick for scientific reasons. People used to believe disease was caused by angry (mad) gods.
Hippocrates wrote about treating sick people. His writings are still important to doctors today. He said many ideas that doctors still study. An idea he wrote about is "patient confidentiality". This means that doctors cannot tell anyone else what their patients tell them. Another idea is that the doctor cannot do anything to kill a patient. These kinds of ideas are part of medical ethics.
The "Hippocratic Oath" is named after him. This is a promise or "oath" doctors say. This means they say they will do what is said in the "Hippocratic Oath". (People now think that Hippocrates did not write it.)
Most medical schools today use a new "version". This means that some things are changed. But the important ideas are the same.
This is an example of a modern "Hippocratic Oath". This is used today at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine.

An endoskeleton is a structure that holds an animal from inside.
One can find endoskeletons in three phyla and one subclass of animals: in Chordata, Echinodermata, Porifera and Coleoidea. An endoskeleton allows the body to move and gives the body structure and shape.
A true endoskeleton develops from mesodermal tissue. Such a skeleton is present in echinoderms and chordates. The Coleoidae do not have a true endoskeleton in the evolutionary sense; here, a mollusc exoskeleton developed into several sorts of internal structure, the "cuttlebone" of cuttlefish being the best-known version. An important advantage of an endoskeleton over an exoskeleton is that the endoskeleton provides more structural support.

The beluga whale ("Delphinapterus leucas") is a small, toothed whale that is white as an adult.

The beluga's body is stout and has a small, blunt head with a small beak, tiny eyes, thick layers of blubber, and a rounded melon. They have one blowhole. Beluga means "white one" in Russian. Its genus Delphinapterus, means "whale without fins", and the species, "leucas", means "white". The beluga is also called the white whale, the white porpoise, the sea canary (because of its songs), and the squid hound (due to its diet). Unlike most other cetaceans, the beluga's seven neck vertebrae are not fused, giving it a flexible, well-defined neck.

Belugas are toothed whales with 34 teeth. The teeth are not designed for chewing, but for grabbing and tearing prey. They swallow their prey whole. They are opportunistic feeders, eating a varied diet of fish, squid, crustaceans, octopi, and worms. They are both benthic (bottom) and pelagic (oceanic) feeders (in shallow water). Belugas sometimes hunt schools of fish cooperatively in small groups.

A wormhole is a shortcut through time and space. It is not known if wormholes really exist. Scientists believe that if they existed they could be created by black holes. In order to hold open a wormhole, a form of negative energy, the opposite to gravity, would be needed, otherwise the wormhole would simply disappear very quickly after its creation. Wormholes also have black holes in them. The wormhole has a 2d spot and it folds and anything that goes through is warped to the other side.

The AIM-9 Sidewinder is a short-range air-to-air missile, which means it is shot from an aircraft and is supposed to hit an aircraft. It is heat seeking, which means it locks on to heat. It first flew in 1953, and went into air forces in 1956. It was used during the Vietnam War along with the AIM-7 Sparrow, but was not good. At the time, it would hit only 10-20% of the time, and could be fooled. Sometimes it could lock on to the sun or other bogus heat source and not an enemy airplane.
The problems were later fixed, and the new Sidewinders have a good hitting rate. It is in a lot of air forces. The missile can hit from 11 miles. It is used a lot.

Methane is a hydrocarbon that is a gas at room temperature (20oC). Its molecular formula is CH4, so it has one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms in a molecule. It is often found as the main part of natural gas. Methane is a greenhouse gas 22 times more effective than carbon dioxide. It is also less stable and slowly oxidates by oxygen to carbon dioxide and water.

Methane is used in gas taps in places such as chemistry classrooms, laboratories, etc. as it burns very easily because of it's simple molecular structure.

Methane's molecular structure is very simple. It is a single carbon atom surrounded by four hydrogen atoms.

Methane can be produced by many chemical methods, but usually is found in natural gas and is obtained by fractional distillation, after it is become liquid.

Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel
Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel is a mathematical paradox named after a famous German mathematician David Hilbert. It is used to show how infinity does not act in the same way as regular numbers do.
In regular hotel, with a finite number of rooms, even if it is very big, it is obvious that if there is a guest in every room, we can't find a room for another guest without making two guests live in the same room. Then imagine a hotel, called Grand Hotel, with an infinite number of rooms, which is full, so there's a guest in each room. Unlike normal hotels, we still can find a room for a new guest: we move the guest in room number 1 into the room number 2, then the one in the room number 2 into number 3, and we keep moving guests until every guest who was, at start, in room number "n", is moved to room number "n+1", and finally we move the new guest into the room number one. This shows how we can find a room for a new guest even if the hotel is already full, something that could not happen in any hotel with a finite number of rooms.

Bleach is a liquid that is used as a cleaner. It also can cause things to turn white or pale. Bleach can harm people's skin if they do not use it carefully.

Mixing bleach with some things commonly found at home, like vinegar or even fruit juice can produce chemicals like Chlorine that are irritating or even dangerous. Bleach should also not be mixed with ammonia, because a dangerous chemical reaction will occur. This reaction can kill people.
Certain types of bleaches produce toxic waste. Some of them produce dioxins.

Bleach is also used to make hair lighter in color, orange, blonde, or even white. It is often used by dark-haired people to make highlights, and most light hair dyes contain it.
In the textile dye and finish industry, sodium hydrochlorite is available in powder form. It is usually used to strip color from dyed polyester fabrics in order to re dye the fabric. I also find it useful in a final dye stage to clear any excess dye from the polyester fabric. Use a final scour at 60C or 140 F. Use 5% active bleach on the weight of the goods. Drop the final scour bath after bleaching and rinse with clean water at 60C or 140 F. The polyester fabric will pass the 2A wash fastness test even on deep shades.

The exact cause of vitiligo is complex and not fully understood. It may be caused by the immune system, genetic, and environmental factors.
Vitiligo may also be caused by stress that affects the immune system, leading the body to react and start eliminating skin pigment.
People over 20 years old rarely develop this disease. These patches often occur to both sides symmetrically and may change shape.

This disease can also affect the mental state of the patient.

Today, doctors do not understand what causes the disease, so right now, it can not be cured. Some things can be done to fight its effects, though. Makeup or cosmetics can cover up the parts of the skin with vitiligo. Also, staying out of the sun to prevent tanning is good. But the treatment given by most skin doctors is cortico steroid cream.
Breakthrough discovery in 2004 allowed for the transplant of melanocytes to vitiligo affected areas, repigmenting the region.

Bowling is a sport where people roll a ball down a bowling lane to try to knock ten bowling pins down without going into the gutters or missing. There are other kinds of bowling as well.

The bowling ball has three holes in it that the person puts his or her ring, middle, and thumb. The person has to go up to the lane, lift the ball back, and roll the ball down a 60 foot long lane attempting to knock down ten wooden pins. If the person doesn't do it right, the ball might not knock all the pins down or might roll into the gutter. If all the pins get knocked down, the person who throws the ball gets a strike. If the person does not get all the pins down, he or she gets another chance to knock them down. If they get knocked down in the second try, the person gets a spare. There are ten turns (or frames) in bowling, and the goal is to get as many strikes as possible. A perfect game adds up to a max of 300 points, which is very hard to get as the person needs to knock down every single pin.

The Groundhog is a rodent. It belongs to the group of ground squirrels. Those squirrels are also known as marmots. The animal may also be called Woodchuck, or Whistlepig. Groundhogs are subteranean (Sub-tar-ae-nee-an) creatures, which means they dig tunnes and live underground. Groundhog holes, callled burrows, are easy to recognize; they are holes, about 9.in (inches) (23 cm (centimeters)) wide which usually have large piles of dirt and rocks at the entrance. Every single hole, may have tunnels which lead to as many as ten other holes, the tunnels are very large and can have chambers, like rooms, in them. Groundhogs can make their homes under trees, around buildings and in open fields.

Some problems with groundhogs are that they eat crops and dig around the foundations of buildings. When groundhogs dig around buildings this can cause damage if the holes go too far under the building.

There is a holiday called Groundhog Day. It is on 2-2 of every year.

West Virginia is a state in the United States. Its capital and largest city is Charleston. It is often abbreviated W. Va. or simply WV.
West Virginia is bordered by Pennsylvania to the north, by Ohio to the north and west, by Kentucky to the west, by Maryland to the north and east, and by Virginia to the east and south. The Ohio and Potomac Rivers form parts of the boundaries.

West Virginia was once a part of Virginia. At the beginning of the American Civil War, Virginia and the other southern states seceded from the United States, which means they chose to not be a part of it anymore. The people in the western part of the state felt that they had very little power in the state's affairs, including its decision to secede. They seceded from Virginia and formed their own state, West Virginia. After the war, the United States was brought back together, but West Virginia never rejoined Virginia.

West Virginia is often called the "Mountain State" because it is entirely within the Appalachian Mountain Range, and there are many hills and mountains throughout the state. The highest one is Spruce Knob, which is 4 863 feet above see level. There are many rivers, including the Ohio, the Potomac, the Kanawha, and the Monongahela.

The Stray Cats were a Rockabilly band from the United States. They had several hit songs in the 1980s. The Stray Cats played a style of pop music called Rockabilly, which mixes 1950s-style rock and roll, blues music, and country music together. The Stray Cats' music is like the 1950s Rockabilly songs by Elvis Presley and Carl Perkins. Three of the bands' hit songs were "Runaway Boys," "Rock This Town," and "Stray Cat Strut."
The Stray Cats band was formed in 1979 by Brian Setzer, with two of his school friends Leon Drucker (who used the stage name "Lee Rocker") and James McDonnell (who used the stage name "Slim Jim Phantom"). These young men lived in Massapequa, New York.
The Stray Cats wore blue jeans and leather jackets, and had their hair slicked back. The Stray Cats had a singer who played electric guitar, a double bass player, and a drummer.

Breinigerberg is a small village in the West of Germany, the state of North Rhine-Westphalia About 972 people live at the place. It is close to the "Naturpark Nordeifel", a large forest area in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.
The road L12 passes through Breinigerberg splitting it into two parts.
In the last two centuries, Breinigerberg was famous for mining. Even the ancient Romans dug for ore in the area. It was used for the production of brass in the city of Stolberg. Today there is no more mining but the remains are still present. Big holes in the Schlangenberg area prove what had been left from the past. Today the Schlangenberg is a natural reserve protecting rare flowers and insects.

Karakoram Range of mountains starting in the extreme north of Hindu Kush Range mountain and extending eastward in the north of Baltistan District ends in the northeast corner of the state of Jammu & Kashmir. The range is spread over a length of 482 km, and it covers a tract 46 to 48 km broad. Karakoram separates the State of Jammu and Kashmir from Tibet, and Central Asian States. It also protects Kashmir fromthe extreme cold winds of Siberia. There are over 300 peaks with an elevation between 5200 and 28000 feet from the sea level. Out of these peaks, 150 are situated in Baltistan. The world's highest peak K2 (8611 M/ 28251 feet) is situated within this range. World famous glaciers, the Siachen Glacier, Masherbroom and Gaisherbroom are also situated in Karakoram range. Many hilly lakes and hot-water springs can also be found here The different valleys of Karakoram gave birth to many rivers, rivulets, streams which at last drain in the great Indus River. 18300 feet high Karakoram Pass, connects Kashmir with Central Asian states and is considered to be a historical route. Shaksgam Pass, Aghil Pass, and Khunjerab Pass are also situated in this range of mountains.

The Southern Railway (SR) gave the designation Sub to the wide variety of electric multiple units that were used on inner-suburban workings in the South London area. Originally these units were formed as three-car units, but in the 1940s, all surviving units were increased to four cars by the addition of an 'Augmentation' trailer. New four-car units were also built at this time, and these survived in passenger use until late 1983, by which time British Rail had allocated to them TOPS Class 405.

Cockatoos are 21 species of birds that make up the family "Cacatuidae". They come from Australia and the East Indies. The upper jaw of the bill overlaps the narrow lower jaw.
The cockatoo builds its nest in a high tree hole in the tropical forest. The female lays two white eggs on wood chips. The young, which hatch naked and blind are fed by the adults by regurgitation of partially digested food for about three months. Cockatoos often travel in immense flocks numbering many thousands. They make good pets and are found in all zoos Cockatoos come in all different colours, but the most common is white.

A task is a set of program instructions that are loaded in memory, then the address registers is loaded with the initial address to start running the task. Is is defined as "an execution path through address space where part of a plan will be accomplished after executing the task'".
Processes are often called tasks in embedded operating systems so "task" gives a meaning of a real-time (also small) application, which differs from a process a process is an instance of a computer program. The kernel creates a process by allocating some memory (in kernel address space and user address space), loading program code from a disk or another part of memory into the newly allocated space, building the process tables and other operating systems structures, calculating the initial address then executes the process as one or more tasks.
Both "task" and "process" should be distinguished from event, which takes place at a specific time and place, and which can be planned for in a computer program. In a computer graphical user interface (GUI), an event can be as simple as a mouse click or keystroke.

Pyrih (the plural is "pyrohy") is a Ukrainian pie that can have either a sweet or savory filling. In Russia and Belarus it is called pirog (plural is "pirogi").

Pyrih (pirog) is usually made from yeast-raised dough, but can also be made from shortcrust or puff pastry. Pyrohy or pirogi are full-sized pies, while pyrizhky or pirozhki are smaller-sized pies that can be eaten with one hand.
The standard shape for pyrohy is oblong with tapering ends, but rectangular or circular pyrohy are also common. They can be closed or open-faced with no crust on top (like a tart).

The filling for pyrohy may be sweet and contain cottage cheese, or fruits like apple, plums or various berries. Savory versions may consist of meat, fish, mushrooms, cabbage, buckwheat groats or potato. In Ukrainian and Russian cuisines, pyrohy with a savory filling are traditionally served (like pirozhki) together with borscht, or soup.

Sardine is a name of several kinds of fish, especially Oily Phil. Another name for these fish is Pilchard. All of those fish are quite small and are related to the herring. The Latin name of the familiy of those fish is Clupeidae. However, the naming is not precise. Fishbase, a database about all kinds of fish, has six species just named "pilchard". There are over a dozen with the name of "sardine". Many more exist, with the basic names qualified by adjectives.
The fish are named after the Island of Sardinia. In the past, they could easily be fished there.
Many shops and supermarkets sell canned (or tinned) "sardines". Very often, those fish are not sardines, but rather sprats or round herrings.

The Epipaleolithic or "peripheral old stone age" is a term used for the hunter-gatherer cultures that existed after the end of the last ice age, before the Neolithic.
The term is sometimes confused with Mesolithic, and the two are sometimes used as synonyms. Yet, when a distinction is made, Epipaleolithic is used for those cultures that where not much effected by the ending of the Ice Age and the term Mesolithic is reserved for Western Europe where the extinction of the Megafauna had a great influence on the paleolithic populations at the end of the Ice Age.

Merchant marine is a term used in many places to talk about commercial ships and crews. A country's merchant marine is made up of all the ships owned by companies or individuals in that country which are used to make money. Most of a country's merchant marine is usually made of ships that carry things from place to place, like oil tankers and freighters. Other ships, like cruise ships and ferries, are also included because they are used to make money. When a country is at peace, its merchant marine works independently. Some countries, though, require merchant ships to work for their armed forces in times of war.
In the United States, "Merchant Marine" has a different meaning. The United States Merchant Marine (USMM) is a part of the military which is controlled by the government in both peace and war. When the United States is at war, the USMM is used to carry military supplies. In World War II, nearly one out of every twenty-six American merchant mariners was killed, a higher portion of men than in the Army, Navy, or even the Marines.

Risk is the possibility of something bad happening. People use the word "risk" when they are actually talking about "probability"; it means, they want to say how likely something is to happen.
People often take risks. This means that they do something that is risky, i.e. that might be dangerous. There is a possibility that something bad might happen.
In epidemiology, risk is defined as the number of events divided by the number of people prone to that event. For example, if the risk of neonatal death in a population is reported as 1/1000, it means that from each 1000 babies born, 1 is likely to die.
Risk is different from prevalence. Prevalence refers to the number of people with a disease in a population, while risk means the number of "new" cases, divided by the number of people who could possibly become a case (for example, those who had a chance to be exposed to the disease).
A risk assessment is a list of things that could go wrong. In many Western countries, when teachers take children on an outing they may have to fill in a risk assessment form which lists all the possible dangers and says what they should do to stop bad things from happening (e.g. accidents or children getting lost).

"Achtung Baby" is the seventh studio album by Irish rock band U2. It was put in stores on 19 November 1991. The album came almost two years after the lead singer, Bono, said that the band would "have to go away and dream it all up again," after their 1988 album, "Rattle and Hum" was criticized.
"Achtung Baby" shows a very big change in U2's sound because they began to use alternative rock and electronic sounds in the rhythm, more production, and more guitar effects, also including darker and more personal song words. The results were much more adventurous and less traditionally rock-based than their previous albums, and "Achtung Baby" is one of U2's best-selling and most-liked albums.

An Earl or Jarl was an Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian title, meaning "chieftain" and it referred especially to chieftains set to rule a territory in a king's stead. In Scandinavia, it got out of use in the Middle Ages, whereas, in Britain, it became synonymous with the continental count.
Today, an earl is a member of the British peerage and ranks below a Marquess and above a Viscount. A British Earl is equivalent to a continental Count. Since there is no feminine form of Earl, the wife of an Earl bears the rank of Countess (the continental equivalent).

The wristwatch (also called a "watch") is a small clock or timepiece that is attached to a person's wrist with a strap. Watches display the time and sometimes the day, date, month and year. In 1524, Peter Henlein created the first pocket watch. Before the 1900s, most watches were pocket watches which were carried in a pocket and attached to a chain.
Before the 1970s, all watches had a numbered dial with a rotating hour hand and a longer minute hand. Since the 1970s, digital watches have been available. Digital watches have small computers inside to keep the time. Instead of having a dial and hands, a digital watch shows the time as a number (e.g., 10:30 AM).

In computer programming, event-driven programming also known as event-based programming is a programming method in which the flow of the program is determined by sensor outputs or user actions such as (mouse clicks, key presses) or by messages from other programs or threads running on the computer.
Event-driven programs can be written using any of the computer programming languages, although the task is easier in languages that provide high-level of abstractions to support it. Some integrated development environments provide all assisting methods that automate most tasks required for events handling.

The dew point is the temperature where water vapour condenses into liquid water.
All air holds different amounts of water vapor. The dew point shows the amount of moisture in the air. The higher the dew point is, the higher the level of moisture in the air at a given temperature. The dew point of humid air will be higher than the dew point of dry air.
Condensation of water vapour starts when the temperature of air is lowered to its dew point and beyond. The dew point, like other measures of humidity, can be found from measurement taken by a hygrometer.

A pesticide is a chemical that is used to kill or prevent animals (or organisms) which are considered to be unwanted. These organisms are called pests. Some of these pests that people do not want are insects, microbes that destroy plants, and other things that affect humans in a bad way. Many pesticides are poisonous, and are bad for not only the organisms it kills, but humans too.

There are different types of pesticides for getting rid of different pests.

Pesticides are used to kill pests, but many are bad for human health. They may pollute water, and go into rivers, lakes, and ponds. This will cause acid rain, and organisms living in the water can get sick and die, because the water where they live has more acid.
Pesticide runoff is very bad for animals, especially amphibians.

A car rental agency or a rent-a-car (car hire in British English) is a company that rents automobiles for short periods of time (ranging from a few hours to a few weeks) for a fee.

They can be found primarily located near airports or busy city areas. The internet is changing the car rental industry with companies that are now called online car rental companies.

Car rental agencies primarily serve people who have a car that is temporarily out of reach or out of service, for example travellers who are out of town or owners of damaged or destroyed vehicles who are awaiting repair or insurance compensation. Because of the variety of sizes of their vehicles, car rental agencies may also serve the self-moving industry needs, by renting vans or trucks.

Car rentals are subject to many conditions which vary from one brand to another. The vehicle must be returned in a good condition and must not exceed a maximum driven distance, otherwise extra fees may be incurred. Additionally, some companies set up a minimum age for the vehicle driver, which in some cases is as high as 25, even in countries where the minimum legal age to hold a driver's license is much lower. Recent conditions have utilised GPS technology to limit maximum speeds or driving to specific regions.

An election is a way people can choose their candidate or their preferences in a democracy or other form of government.
Most democratic countries hold new elections for their national legislature every few years, but this differs from country to country. Some democracies elect other national officials (such as a president). In others, these are appointed. Democratic countries also hold local (or municipal) elections. Some democracies have regional, provincial or state elections too.
There are different ways to organize an election in different countries. Voters might vote for an individual, or they might vote for a political party (party list). This is because different countries use different voting systems.
Countries that are not democracies can also hold elections. This is usually done to let the people choose a local representative (like a mayor). Also many countries call themselves democracies, but behind the scenes have a more autocratic form of government.Elections are done between the main person and the opposition.

A citizen is someone who is a member of a country. People can be citizens because they were born in a country. People can also be "naturalized" citizens. If someone was born in one country but became a citizen of another country, they are a naturalized citizen of that other country. For example, actor Peter Lorre was born 1904 in Hungary. In the 1940s, he moved to the United States and became a citizen of the United States. Lorre was born a Hungarian citizen and later became a naturalized United States citizen.
Someone who live in a smaller area like a city can also be called a citizen of that city.

A tadpole shrimp is a type of simple freshwater crustacean. It has the word "shrimp" in its name, but is not a true shrimp.
called Triops, dinosaur shrimps or shield shrimps. They're not really dinosaurs, but they have been on earth for about 300 million years. When these crustaceans first appeared on earth, there were no birds, no dinosaurs, and definitely no humans or other mammals.They are the oldest surviving group of animals.
They live in temporary pools of water on every continent except Antarctica. They grow very quickly, and can reach adulthood in a week. Triops only live for a short time; a record-breaking female only lived to be 100 "days". When their pools dry up,adult tadpole shrimp die. Their eggs, however, stop developing for a period of time. When they are in water again, they come to life, and new Triops are hatched. This is because of a state known as diapause, where eggs can lie dormant for up to twenty years before hatching again.
Triops are popular pets, with many sites online dedicated to them, the most prominent site being Mytriops.com.
The word "Triops" can be broken down into two shorter ones, "Tri" meaning three and "Ops" similar to optics, eyes. This is due to the fact triops have an extra central eye. They also have up to 70 legs.

The Battle of Normandy was fought in 1944 between the German army and the Allied forces as part of World War II. Sixty years later, the Normandy invasion, codenamed Operation OVERLORD, is the largest invasion by sea in history, involving almost three million troops crossing the English Channel from England to Normandy in then German-occupied France.
The main Allied forces came from the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada, but a total of twelve nations contributed units, the rest being Australia, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, France, Greece, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway and Poland.

Sword Beach was the easternmost beach on D-Day, and was attacked by the British 3rd Infantry Division, supported by units of the 79th Armoured Division. It was successful.

Juno Beach was the next beach to the west. It was attacked by the Canadian 3rd Division. It was also successful.

Gold Beach was the "middle" beach, lying between Sword, Juno, Omaha, and Utah beaches. It was attacked by the British 50th (Northumbrian) Division.

Omaha Beach was the second western-most beach. It was attacked by the American 1st Division. The bombardment before the assault was successful on every beach except Omaha, so German bunkers and artillery still remained. The battle was hard, but eventually the Americans won. More Americans died here than anywere else on D-Day.

Utah beach was the western-most beach. It was mostly successful, and it was attacked by the American 1st Division.

This is a list of residences occupied by the British Royal family, noting the seasons of the year they are traditionally occupied.
Members of the British Royal Family inhabit a range of residences around the United Kingdom. Some are royal palaces, owned by the state and held in trust by the monarch; others are privately owned. Balmoral Castle and Sandringham House have been inherited as private property for several generations. Other royal palaces are no longer residences (e.g. the Palace of Westminster, the Palace of Whitehall). Some remain in irregular use for royal occasions. The Royal Palaces enjoy certain legal privileges, for example there is an exemption from levying duty on alcoholic beverages sold in the bars at the Palace of Westminster and there are exemptions from Health and Safety legislation.
The occupied royal residences of are cared for and maintained by the Royal Household Property Section. The unoccupied royal palaces of England are now within the responsibility of the Historic Royal Palaces Agency.

An Act of Parliament or Act is law enacted by the parliament (see legislation).

An Act of Parliament normally starts as a proposed law known as a Bill. The Bill will then be introduced into the Parliament (House of Commons, House of Representatives, House of Lords or the Senate) for debate and possible approval and enactment.
Bills that contain provisions significantly relating to taxation or public expenditure are introduced into the House of Commons in the UK; in Canada and Ireland, this is the law.
In the United Kingdom, Law Commission bills and consolidation bills start in the House of Lords.
In some countries, such as Spain and Portugal, a Bill has different names depending on whether it comes from the government (eg. "Project") or from the Parliament (eg. "Proposition" or Private Member's Bill).
An Act may be introduced to parliament also by means of a private bill.

It may be manually operated, electrically or pneumatically driven and may use chain, fiber or wire rope as its lifting medium. The load is attached to the hoist by means of a lifting hook.
A "hoist" normally is used for lifting (near vertical) and a winch is normally used for pulling (near horizontal).
Construction sites, especially for buildings of more than five floors in height, often employ hoists to lift workers and building materials.

The basic hoist has two important characteristics to define it: Lifting medium and power type. The lifting medium is either wire rope, wrapped around a drum, or load-chain, raised by a gear-like wheel. The power type can be either electric motor or air motor. Both the wire rope hoist and chain hoist have been in common use since the 1800's.

Autumn is the season after summer and before winter. In Canada and the United States this season is also called fall. In the Northern Hemisphere, it begins with the autumn equinox (late September) and ends with the winter solstice (late December). In the Southern Hemisphere, it runs from 20 March to 21 June.
In many places, autumn is a time for harvesting most crops. Deciduous trees (trees that lose their leaves every year) lose their leaves, usually after turning yellow, red, or brown. Also, in many countries, autumn is the time a new school year starts. In the UK, the period of school between the start of September and the end of December is known as the 'Autumn Term'.
When it is autumn in the Northern Hemisphere, it is spring in the Southern Hemisphere. When it is autumn in the Southern Hemisphere, it is spring in the Northern Hemisphere. On the Equator, Autumn is very much like Spring, with little difference in temperature or in weather. Autumn is a time when most animals are looking for food so they can store up for winter, because they soon will be going into hibernation. The weather gets colder and more windy.

Hooke's Law
The spring equation is the most common type of Hooke's Law.

When x = 0, the spring is at rest. The spring is at the equilibrium position.
There is a negative sign because the force of the spring does not go to the same direction as the spring moves.
This equation only works on a linear spring. A linear spring can only be pushed or pulled in one direction.

Elastic potential energy is the energy saved in an object that is stretched, compressed (compression is pressing objects together), twisted or bent. For example, an arrow gets the elastic potential energy from the bow. When it leaves the bow, the energy turns into kinetic energy.

Blue Line International is an international maritime company. They deal in the transportation of passengers and vehicles between Croatia and Italy.
Blue Line International was started in 1993. Its first passenger ship "Kraljica mira" sailed towards Italy carrying humanitarian aid and refugees. "Kraljica mira" was sailing at that time under the flag of SEM Maritime Company (SMC). In 1997, the passenger ship "Split 1700" joined the same company. In 2003, Blue Line International replaced SMC.
The passenger ship "Ancona", the largest ship in the Adriatic Sea was bought in 2003. It has been sailing together with the passenger ship "Split 1700" for several years on Blue Line's regular route. They maintain the seasonal lines between Ancona and Hvar and between Ancona and Vis.

Boris Abramovich Berezovsky (born January 23, 1946), is a Russian business man, billionaire and former mathematician. He is best known for the powerful positions he held during the 1990s when Boris Yeltsin was president of Russia. He was deputy secretary of Russia's security council, a friend of Boris Yeltsin's daughter Tatyana. He had a lot of power over what the newspapers were allowed to print and what the television stations could say. They were not allowed to say anything bad about Yeltsin.
Berezovsky made a lot of money importing Mercedes cars into Russia in the 1990s. He made a lot of money from Avtovaz cars and he owned Sibneft oil company.
When Putin came to power Berezovsky fled to London where he was given political asylum. He said that he was trying to put an end to Putin's power. The Russian authorities have accused him of trying to murder several leading critics of Putin's regime, including Alexander Litvinenko and journalist Anna Politkovskaya, in order to make Putin look bad. The Swiss have accused him of taking money illegally.
In 1994 someone tried to kill Berezovsky. Several other people may have tried to kill him. He says these people are Russian spies.

Painting is using colours to make art. It is also the word for a painted work of art. Many kinds of paints are used to create art. They include watercolors, acrylics and oils. Other artists like working with pencil or chalk.
Famous paintings are often kept in art galleries, like the National Gallery in London and the Louvre (Paris) where one of the most famous paintings in the world hangs, The Mona Lisa, painted by Leonardo DaVinci. People do not have to go to a famous gallery to view art. There are private art galleries in many cities around the world.
There is a basic difference between drawing and painting. In drawing, single layer constitues entire image. In painting a layer over other is painted to get the final image. As a result, most of the times the image will not be clear until it gets to final stage.

In divide stage, the canvas is divided into a few major areas (depending on the image you paint) and background for those areas are plotted.
In layer stage, a layer over other layer is plotted to get the desired shape in each area. By end of this stage, all objects in the image will be clearly identifible.
The touchup stage needs extra effort. This stage is to provide extra look to the image like precise bordering, merging layers and other visual effects.

Frankfort, Kentucky
Frankfort is the capital city of the U.S. state of Kentucky. It has been the state capital since December 8, 1792. It is the county seat of Franklin County, and has been since 1795.
Frankfort is beside the Kentucky River. This is how the city earned its name, because the land was owned by pioneer Stephen Frank. First called "Frank's Ford", the name was soon shortened to Frankfort.
Within a century the population of Frankfort grew from 9,487 in 1900, to 27,741 in 2000. The members of the city commission and the mayor are elected by the citizens.
The mayor of Frankfort in 2006 is William May.

The Zip drive is a data storage device. The company Iomega published it in late 1994.
Originally it only supported 100 MB disks, but later versions began to support 250 MB and 750 MB disks. Now capacities have reached 1GB and 2GB disks.
Higher capacity Zip disks must be used in a drive with at least the same capacity ability. Generally, higher capacity drives also handle all lower capacity media. However, it is slower to write data on a 100 MB disk with a 250 MB Zip drive than with a 100 MB Zip drive.
Zip drives can transmit data to the computer in various ways. Internal drives have been made with IDE and SCSI interfaces. External drives can use SCSI, parallel port or USB interface.
Zip disks are thicker than 3.5" (9 cm) floppy disks. Nevertheless, zip disks are quite similar in appearance to regular floppy disks. This means the Zip drive slot is large enough to accept such a floppy disk.

A wallaroo is a macropod with its size between the big kangaroos and the small wallabies. The name "wallaroo" is a mix of wallaby and kangaroo. Most wallaroos are smaller than a kangaroo, and are found in open, rocky country. Wallaroo means "rock kangaroo". There are 3 types of wallaroo. They all stand the same way: wrists raised, elbows close into the body, and shoulders back, and all have a large, black nose.
"Macropus robustus", called the Eastern Wallaroo, Common Wallaroo or just Wallaroo lives on the sides of the Great Dividing Range (which runs for more than 3,000 km along the eastern and south-eastern coast of Australia). There are four subspecies: the Eastern Wallaroo and the Euro, which are both widespread across Australia. Two others live in small areas only, one from Barrow Island, the other from the Kimberley area of Western Australia.
The Woodward's Wallaroo or Black Wallaroo ("Macropus bernardus") lives in steep, rocky ground in Arnhem Land. Between 60 to 70 cm in length (without tail) it is the smallest wallaroo and the most heavily built. Males weigh 19 to 22 kg, females about 13 kg.
The Antilopine Wallaroo ("Macropus antilopinus") also called the Antilopine Kangaroo is different to other wallaroos. It is, more like the Eastern and Western Grey Kangaroos. It lives in groups on the grassy plains and woodlands, where the other wallaroos live by themselves.

Thousand Foot Krutch are a hard rock band who formed in 1997.
They have released a number of albums, the latest being The Flame in All of Us
While TFK had rap influences, obvious with trevors vocals in earlier TFK albums, the two most recent ones have moved away from that, and used a more rock based sound.
While "The Last Song" from the band's latest album, has been thought by some to be an outro from the band, TFK still continues touring, and Trevor has said that they were very tired and it's only a sarcastic "Here it all is: love it or hate it".

The band is known for a lot of touring. They usually do 200 concerts in a year.
Spring 2008 (march to may) is when TFK went on the comatose Tour (see Concert) and performed in over 30 cities. They have toured with bands such as skillet.

The name thousand foot krutch came from the belief that God is a crutch you can lean on, even if your problems pile thousand feet high. What they mean is, you can ask God for help even if you have very serious or many problems in your life.
They have gone through certain line-up changes. For example, steve austine has not always been a part of this, and christian harvey was their original drummer.

In chemistry and physics an atomic theory explains what the basic structure of matter is like. It says that all of matter is made up of tiny parts called atoms, and attempts to explain what atoms are like. Atomic theory has changed over time, but one of the earliest known atomic theories was explained by the Greek philosopher Democritus. A lot of the ideas in the modern theory came from John Dalton, a British chemist and physicist.
The theory applies to solids, liquids and gases, but it does not apply to plasmas or neutron stars, where temperature and density stop atoms from forming.

Applied mechanics, also known as theoretical and applied mechanics, is a branch of the physical sciences and the practical application of mechanics. Applied mechanics examines the "response of bodies (solids and fluids) to external forces". Some examples of "mechanical systems" include the flow of a liquid under pressure, the fracture of a solid from an applied force, or the vibration of an ear in response to sound. A practitioner of the discipline is known as a mechanician.
Applied mechanics, as its name suggests, bridges the gap between physical theory and its application to technology.

An archive is a collection of records. The term is also used for the location in which these records are kept. Archives are made up of records which have been created during the course of an individual or organization's life. In general, an archive consists of records which have been selected for permanent or long-term preservation. Records, which may be in any media, are normally unpublished, unlike books and other publications. Archives may also be generated by large organisations such as corporations and governments. Archives are different from libraries in that archives hold records which are unique. Archives can be described as holding information "by-products" of activities, while libraries hold specifically authored information "products". The word 'archives' is the correct terminology, whereas 'archive' as a noun or a verb is related to computer science.
A person who works in archives is called an archivist. The study and practice of organizing, preserving, and providing access to information and materials in archives is called archival science.

Silence was founded back in 1995 in Bavaria, Germany. Its founding members were Stefan Mueller (Guitar), Holger Kronester(Drums), and the brothers Bernd (Guitar) and Marco Wolf (Bass). From the beginning they played a mix of rock and metal, but always with a dark, depressive side.
The band's first successful record was Enola (e.g. "Album of the month" in German Metal-Hammer). It was released in 2000.
Three years later they recorded the p/o/u/r letters, a 8-track masterpiece, which received once again great reviews all over Germany and Europe.
In 2007 they released their 5-track e.p. the badtime stories, which made them become a record deal with the German label Biohazzard Records, a sublabel of Danse macabre.
The today's cast of the band is constant since 2003 and consists of Stefan Mueller (Vocals), Bernd Wolf (Guitar), Sebastian Koos (Keyboard), Christian Marsch (Guitar), Oliver Goess (Bass) and Bastian Mattlener (Drums).

Ganymede is the largest moon of Jupiter, and also the largest in the Solar System. Ganymede is larger in diameter than Mercury, but has only about half its mass, as Ganymede's density is much less. Ganymede can be seen from Earth with the naked eye, if not for the brighter light of nearby Jupiter. Other than possibly the other Galilean Satellites; Io, Europa and Callisto; the only other planetary satellite visible with the naked eye is our own Moon.
Ganymede's discoverer is Galileo Galilei who confirmed its existence in 1610. The name Ganymede was suggested soon after by Simon Marius, named after the cup-bearer of the Greek gods, beloved of Zeus. This name and the names of the other Galilean satellites was not favoured for a long time, and were not put into common use until the mid-20th century. Instead, it is simply referred to by its Roman numeral designation (a system that was introduced by Galileo) as or as the "third satellite of Jupiter". Ganymede is the only Galilean moon of Jupiter named after a male figure.

Gold is a soft, heavy, dark yellowish piece of shiny metal that has been used for many thousands of years by people all over the world, for jewelry, as money, and now in tooth fillings and electronic equipment such as computers. It was especially admired as jewelry in early times because of its great luster and beauty. In Exodus it was used as part of the clothes the priests wore. The color of this metal is also called "gold".

In chemistry, gold is chemical element 79, a transition metal in Group 11. It has an atomic weight of 199.96 a.m.u. Its symbol is Au, from the Latin word for gold, "aurum".
Gold is very soft, which means it can be hammered into thin sheets; and ductile, which means it can be pulled into wire. When it is used in money or in jewelry, it is often mixed with silver or some other metal to make it harder.
Most metals are gray in color. Gold's yellow color comes from the way that electrons behave in it.
There have been many discoveries of gold in Australia. The most important discovery of gold there was probably discovered by Sir Edward Hargraves. He started the first Australian gold rush.

Temperature record of the past 1000 years
Many scientists and others are interested in the temperature record of Earth. Especially the temperature changes in the past 1000 years.
Temperatures were not measured that far back, so weather records are used. Unfortunatly, the weather records can be wrong, so the final temperature records are not accurate.
The average worldwide temperature will drop in about two centuries, for an ice age will occur.
As fresh water, from the melting ice caps, is added to the Atlantic Ocean, the North Atlantic Current will come to a halt. This current is based on a balance of salt water and fresh water. Fresh water from the ice caps will damage this balance, the current will stop, and Europe, which is kept warm during the winter because of the North Atlantic Current, will freeze.

The Parma Wallaby (Macropus Parma) is the smallest of the macropus genus. It can grow up to 52 cm in length, with a tail about the same length. They weigh up to 5 kg.The Parma wallaby's fur is a grey-brown colour on the back with a dark stripe. It has a white stripe on its face, and a white belly.
In the late 1800's it was thought to be extinct. Parma Wallabies had been introduced and established on Kauwau Island, New Zealand, where they were rediscovered in the 1960's. A lot of effort was made to capture and take the wallabies back to Australia. A small, wild group was found in Gosford, New South Wales in the 1970s by Eric Worrell from the Australian Reptile Park. Parma wallabies are officially listed as vulnerable because there are not many of them, they only live in small areas, and they are threatened by land clearing and other animals such as foxes.

"For the Wikipedia term, please see Vandalism."
Vandalism is destroying or damaging the property of another. A person that does this is called a "vandal". This includes graffiti and website damage. This is usually illegal. Often, vandals do this because they think it is funny or because they want attention or to feel big, or bad.
The name "vandal" is from the Vandals, a group of people who ruined Ancient Rome in the year 455 CE.
Vandalism is almost always a crime; different types of vandalism include: graffiti, smashing the windows of cars and houses, and rioting.

Nicomachus (c. 60-c. 120, born in Gerasa, Roman Syria, now Jerash, Jordan). He was one of the most important mathematicians of the ancient world.
He was strongly influenced by Aristotle and is best known for his works "Introduction to Arithmetic" (Arithmetike eisagoge) and "The Manual of Harmonics" in Greek. He was a Pythagorean. In "Introduction to Arithmetic", Nicomachus writes extensively on number, especially on the significance of prime numbers and perfect numbers and argues that arithmetic is ontologically prior to the other mathematical sciences (geometry, music, and astronomy), and is their cause.

Warwick Castle (pron. 'Worrick') is a large castle in Warwickshire, England. It is near the town of Warwick. The castle was once the family home of the Earls of Warwick.
There are many room in the castle. Some of the rooms have mannequins in them that look like real people. These are dressed in costume. They are used to show how people might have lived in the castle hundreds of years ago. Warwick Castle has a dungeon. One part of the castle is said to be haunted. Actors play the part of the ghost and the servant who killed him in a dramatic "Spook Experience". Lights and sounds are used to add to the effect.
The castle has a very high wall walk. It can be explored, so that visitors can see from where the guards looked for enemies. A long, steep flight of steps leads up to the highest part of the castle where the flagpole is.
There are many paintings in the castle. There are portraits of English Kings and Queens as well as of members of the family who owned the castle. It is possible to see the private chambers, or bedrooms, where the family and their most important guests slept.

An aspirator is a device that makes vacuum, due to the Venturi effect. In the aspirator, fluid flows through it. The tube narrows, making the fluid flow faster, and reducing the pressure. Then, vacuum is taken from it. The aspirator is also known as an ejector or a filter pump.
The most common type of aspirator is the water aspirator. It is used in laboratories for chemistry and biology. The aspirator has a fitted tee, which is attached to a faucet. It has a hose barb on one side. The flow of water passes through the straight part of the tee, which restricts the water flow at the intersection with the hose barb. The vacuum hose should be connected to this barb.
The strength of the produced vacuum is limited by the vapour pressure of the flowing water. However, the strength of the vacuum is not limited if a gas is used as the working force.

The Maple Leaf flag became Canada's flag on 15 February 1965.
Before this Canada used the British Red Ensign with Canada's coat of arms on it. Flag experts say that the Red Ensign was "defaced" by the coat of arms.
Flag and heraldry experts also call the design of the flag a "Canadian Pale". This is because the white stripe in the middle (called a pale in heraldry) was not the usual narrow stripe but was half the width of the flag. This was the first time a design like this was used.
On some days the Canadian government flies the "Royal Union Flag" next to the Maple Leaf Flag. The Royal Union Flag is the British Union Jack, and is a symbol that Canada is a member of the Commonwealth, and that Canada and Britain share a history and a monarch.

Ecological yield is the harvestable growth of an ecosystem. It is most commonly measured in forestry - in fact sustainable forestry is defined as that which does not harvest more wood in a year than has grown in that year, within a given patch of forest.
However, the concept is also applicable to water, and soil, and any other aspect of an ecosystem which can be both harvested and renewed - the so-called renewable resources. The carrying capacity of an ecosystem is reduced over time if more than the amount which is "renewed" (refreshed or regrown or rebuilt).
Nature's services analysis calculates the global yield of the Earth's biosphere to humans as a whole. This is said to be greater in size than the entire human economy. However, it is more than just yield, but also the natural processes that increase biodiversity and conserve habitat which result in the total value of these services. "Yield" of ecological commodities like wood or water, useful to humans, is only a part of it.
Very often an ecological yield in one place offsets an ecological load in another. Greenhouse gas released in one place, for instance, is fairly evenly distributed in the atmosphere, and so greenhouse gas control can be achieved by creating a carbon sink literally anywhere else.
Ecocide is thought by some green economists to be accelerated by debt instruments which demand a yield (economics) greater than the ecological capacity to renew. This is a major question in monetary reform.

The English country house is generally accepted as a large house that was once in the ownership of an individual who in most of the cases owned another great house in the West End of London. The country house was not only a weekend retreat for aristocrats, but also often a full time residence for the minor gentry.

The country houses of England have developed over the last 500 years. Before this time larger houses were fortified in most of the cases, because their owners were feudal lords or overlords of their manor. The Tudor period of stability in the country saw the first of the large unfortified coutry houses.

With the rise of modern industry, when people left the country to go to the big cities coutry houses decned as there were less people in the country. After 1945 it became very difficult to pay for the huge staff that was required to maintain these houses.

Historically, the word "dirham" is comes from 'dirhem' which comes from the name of a Greek coin, the Drachm; the Byzantine Empire controlled the Levant and traded with Arabia, circulating the coin there in pre-Islamic times and afterward. It was this currency which was first used as an Arab word. Near the end of the 7th century, the coin became an Islamic currency. It had the name of the sovereign and a religious verse on it. The dirham was used by many Mediterranean countries, including Spain. It could be used as currency in Europe between the 10th and 12 centuries.

The Armenian dram is a currency whose name bears a similar origin. The dinar is a currency used in the Muslim world but originating with the Romans.

Tautavel man is the name of an extinct hominian. They lived about 300.000-450.000 years ago., It is named after fossils found in a cave on the site named Caune de l'Arago, near Tautavel, France. The first fossils were found there in 1971. The fossils date from between 300.000 and 450.000 years ago. They consist of over 80 fragments; the skull found (pictured) belonged to a man in his twenties. He was about 1.65 m, and weighted around 45-55 kg. Other remains are two mandibles, belonging to a woman in her fifties, and to a man, about 20-25 years old. It looks like they did not know how to use fire yet. It also looks like they might have been cannibals, or that they preferred to scavenge for food, rather than hunt. Bones of rhinoceros, horses, wild sheep (called Mouflon), Tahrs (resemble wild goats), Muskox (some kind of bovine), deer, and reindeer have been found in the cave. There is an ongoing debate if this hominid is directly related to the Neanderthal - If they aren't they would be Homines erecti.. If they are direct predecessors of the Neanderthals, they would be Homo heidelbergensis. It has been proposed to classify them as "Homo erectus Tautavelensis".

The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland uses as its national flag the royal banner known as the "Union Flag" or, popularly, "Union Jack". The design today of the Union Flag comes from the union of Ireland and Great Britain in 1801. It has the red cross of Saint George (patron saint of England), edged in white, on top of the Cross of Saint Patrick (patron saint of Ireland), which are on the Saltire of Saint Andrew (patron saint of Scotland).
Its correct measurements are 1:2 (i.e. the bottom is twice as long as the sides). However, the version used by the British Army is 3:5, and two of the red diagonals are cropped.

The Union Jack has a legacy for flags, and most of the former colonies of Britain have this design on their own flags (i.e Australia, Fiji, Hawaii, some provinces of Canada, etc).

Igneous rocks are formed when molten rock (magma) cools down to form crystals or minerals. Examples are granite and basalt. The word "igneous" is derived from the Latin "ignis", meaning "fire", another way to learn this is Igneous "Ignite". Igneous rocks would be found near volcanoes.
Magma is made up of atoms and molecules of melted minerals. When magma cools the atoms and molecules rearrange to form mineral grains. Rock forms when minerals grains grow together
Igneous volcanic glass are pumice, obsidian, and scoria and much more. These rocks cool very fast and leave minerals behind and form these rocks. it's just solidified magma that has minerals or none in it floating with a lot of elements like silicon and aluminum. These rocks make up 95% of the Earths crust.
Intrusive igneous rocks form when earth's magma cools beneath the surface until hardened. Extrusive igneous rocks form when earth's magma is forced to the surface where it cools until hardened. Most igneous rocks are porous.

A journalist is a person who works in journalism. There are different kinds of journalists: newspaper reporters, television journalists, etc.
A newspaper reporter is a person who works for a newspaper. Newspaper reporters write news articles and stories for newspapers. Newspaper reporters write these articles and stories by interviewing people, asking questions, and doing research.
Newspaper reporters must tell the truth when they write newspaper articles. Telling the truth is a very important part of all journalism jobs, including newspaper reporting, television news reporting, and radio news reporting. If people who work in journalism do not tell the truth in their articles or stories, they can be punished such as being suspended (don't work for a a short time) or fired (losing their jobs).

Lowland Scots, sometimes called simply "Scots" or sometimes "Lallans", is spoken in some parts of Scotland, mainly in the south and east, and Ulster in the north of Ireland. Some people consider Scots to be a language and some consider it to be a form of English. It should not be confused with the Scottish Gaelic language, which is a Celtic language.
Scots differs from standard English in vocabulary and grammar, and it is not the same as English with a Scottish accent. Activists for Scots have pressured the government of the United Kingdom to recognise it as a regional language of the United Kingdom.
The most famous writer of literature in Lowland Scots is Robert Burns.

An adventure is something exciting that happens to someone. An adventure can be a made-up story, or it can be something that happens in real life.
People often like to read stories about a person or a group of people who go off and have an adventure. There is often some danger in the story. Enid Blyton wrote stories about The Famous Five who go off to have exciting adventures. Harry Potter has lots of adventures: he meets strange people and gets into lots of dangerous situations.
People in real life like to have adventures. They may be explorers who like to go to far-away places where no one has ever been before.
Adventure sports are sports that are exciting but can be rather dangerous. Skydiving, gliding and rock climbing are adventure sports.
An adventure playground is a playground for children where they can climb, swing and jump on things. They have been made by adults for children to use and are normally quite safe.
An adventurer is someone who spends all his life going on adventures or doing things that are risky.
Space travel is an example of a modern adventure.

A lock is a thing that keeps people from opening something, such as a door or a box. People can close the lock on a door to keep people from coming in. This is called "locking" the door.

A combination lock is a lock that uses a dial (a knob with numbers all around it) to open it. Someone must turn the dial to the right numbers in the right order. This is called the "combination." This lock is used on safes and locks for bicycles.
A key lock is a lock that uses a key (a piece of metal with teeth like a little saw) to open it. Someone must put the key in the lock and turn it to open the lock. This lock is used in doors and locks for boxes.
An electronic lock is a special lock that can only be opened with a message from a computer. This message can be stored in a computer chip on a card (called a "key card" or "security card"). Or it can be made by a computer looking at someone's fingerprint or eye.

An atoll is a kind of island. It is a coral reef that makes a ring, or part of a ring. There may be just water inside the atoll, or there may be one or more regular islands.
Charles Darwin, who is most famous for his theory of evolution, was the first person to find out how atolls form. He said that volcanoes in the ocean sometimes wear away or sink deeper. Coral growing on a volcano likes to be near the surface, and it keeps growing to stay there.
Most atolls are in the warm parts of the Pacific Ocean or the Indian Ocean.

In road bicycle racing, and especially the three Grand Tour stage races (Tour de France, Italy and Spain, the Green jersey is the name given to a cycling jersey worn by the leader in a subsidiary competition.
For example, while the overall race leader in the Tour de France will wear the yellow jersey, or "maillot jaune", the green jersey ("maillot vert") will be worn by the leader in the points competition for sprinters.
In the Giro d'Italia and Vuelta a Espana the green jersey is worn by the "King of the Mountains", the leader in the competition for the best climber.

The following events use the "green jersey" to signify the current leader and/or final winner of the overall classification by time

Local governments are administrative offices that are smaller than a state or province. The term is used to contrast with offices at nation-state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government.
The institutions of local government vary greatly between countries, and even where similar arrangements exist, the terminology often varies. Common names for local government entities include state, province, region, department, county, prefecture, district, city, township, town, borough, parish, municipality, shire and village. However all these names are often used informally in countries where they do not describe a legal local government entity.

A Salt evaporation pond (or saltern pond) is a man-made shallow pond. Usually it is located near the sea. The ponds can be filled with salt water. The water is then left to evaporate. The salt is left behind, and can be harvested. Such ponds also provide a habitat for several kinds of animals. Most of these animals are birds.
The color tells how much salt there is left in the water. Green colors come from special algae. These algae are there in low to mid salinity ponds (ponds with little salt in the water). In middle to high salinity ponds, an alga called Dunaliella salina shifts the color to red. Millions of tiny brine shrimp create an orange cast in mid-salinity ponds. Other bacteria such as Stichococcus also contribute tints. These colors are especially interesting to airplane passengers or astronauts passing above due to their somewhat artistic formations of shape and color.

A hydrogen atom is an atom of the chemical element hydrogen.
Its parts are a single negatively-charged electron that circles a single positively-charged nucleus of the hydrogen atom. The nucleus of hydrogen consists of only a single proton (in the case of hydrogen-1 or "protium"), "or" it may also include one or more neutrons (giving deuterium, tritium, and other isotopes). The electron is bound to the nucleus by the Coulomb force. Hydrogen-1, also known as protium or "light hydrogen" is the main component of natural hydrogen.

Section 4.2 deals with the hydrogen atom specifically, but all of Chapter 4 is relevant.

Earth's orbit
All planets in our solar system follow an elliptical path. This path is known as an orbit. Earth's orbit is elliptical but so much like a circle that if you were to draw the Earth's orbit on a sheet of paper as a perfect circle, the width of the line would be larger than the elliptical path of the Earth.
The Earth's orbit takes about 365 days, this is also called a year. This means that in 365 days (a year) the Earth has gone completely around the Sun. From this we can find that the Earth is actually moving at about 67,000 miles per hour through space.
The closest distance Earth is to the sun is 146 million km (91 million miles) and the farthest is 152 million km (94.5 million miles).
The seasonal changes on Earth are because of the 23 degree tilt of its rotation axis and slightly elliptical path around the Sun.

MEPIS (pronunciation: meh-pis) is a set of Linux Distributions distributed as Live CDs. The most popular of these distributions is SimplyMEPIS. MEPIS distributions are based on Debian, some of them indirectly. For example, SimplyMEPIS 7.0 is based mainly on Debian, with additional source code from Ubuntu (which is also based on Debian). MEPIS distributions are created by Warren Woodford.
It can either be installed onto a hard drive or used as a Live CD, which makes it a boot disc for troubleshooting many operating systems. It includes KDE, the K Desktop Environment.

MEPIS was designed as an alternative to SUSE Linux, Red Hat Linux, and Mandriva Linux (formerly Mandrake) which, in the creator Warren Woodford's opinion, were too difficult for the average user. MEPIS's first official release was on May 10, 2003.

The most popular MEPIS distribution, SimplyMEPIS, is designed for everyday desktop and laptop computing. SimplyMEPIS 7.0 contains several new packages and features. It contains Linux 2.6.22 and OpenOffice.org 2.3.0. It was released on 2007-12-23.

Colle di Val d'Elsa
Colle di Val d'Elsa or Colle Val d'Elsa is a town and "comune" in Tuscany, Italy, in the province of Siena. It has a population of c. 20,000 inhabitans (2005). Its name in italian means "Hill of Elsa Valley", where "Elsa" is the name of the river which crosses it. Today, Colle di Val d'Elsa is internationally renowned for the production of crystal glassware and art, largely produced in the industrial lower town.

The area was settled by man from at least the 4th millennium BC. In 1269 it was the seat of a famous battle during the wars of Guelphs and Ghibellines and in 1479 it was attacked by Neapolitan soldiers. From the 14th century it was under the control of the city of Florence and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany until the unification of Italy in 1860. In the 20th century it became an important industrial town. During World War II it was bombed by Allied aircraft. The oldest part of the town is the "colle alta", the higher part, with a well preserved medieval center. The city is also famous as the birthplace of sculptor and architect Arnolfo di Cambio.

According to the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church, Purgatory is the "final purification of the elect": "All who die in God's grace and friendship, but still imperfectly purified, are indeed assured of their eternal salvation; but after death they undergo purification, so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven."

Perhaps the best-known instance of purgatory in the arts is Dante's "Purgatorio", the second book of his "Divine Comedy". Likewise, the Ghost in William Shakespeare's "Hamlet" may also presuppose a belief in purgatory,

A spa town, or simply spa, is a town that many people go to for health reasons. There is usually a spring there, or several springs. The water that comes from these springs is good for curing many illnesses. When people go to a spa town to get better we say that they go to "take the waters".
The word "spa" comes from the Belgian town Spa. In continental Europe a spa was called a "ville d'eau" (town of water). The term "spa" is used for towns or resorts which offer hydrotherapy (making people better with water). This can include cold water or mineral water treatments and hot thermal baths.

In popular use, eccentricity or extravagance refers to unusual or odd behavior on the part of an individual. This behavior would typically be perceived as unusual or unnecessary. Eccentricity is contrasted with "normal" behavior, the nearly universal means by which individuals in society solve given problems and act in everyday life. Eccentric behavior may be good, or malicious. Spending a lot of money in nonsensical things, for example, is usually seen as eccentricity. Sometimes, it can be associated with genius; others, with madness. Albert Einstein and Nero, for example, were both eccentrics, but of very different type.

Debate (American English) or debating (British English) is a formal method of argument.
It is a larger form of argument than logical argument, because in a debate, the debaters try to influence the feelings of the hearers, in order to persuade them on a topic.
Informal debates like discussion are very common, but the quality of a debate improves with knowledge and skill of its participants as debaters.
Deliberative bodies such as parliaments, legislative assemblies, and meetings of all sorts have debates. The winner of a debate may be decided by the audiences vote, by judges, or by both. Formal debates between candidates for a elected office, such as the leaders debates and the U.S. presidential election debates, are common in democracies.

Hallstatt is a village in Upper Austria. Currently, a little over 900 people live there. It is in the Salzkammergut, a mountain range in Austria. It lies on a lake.
Because of its position, Hallstatt could only be reached by boat (or by using narrow, difficult mountain trails for a long time. At the end of the 19th century a road was built. Despite this, even in the Neolithic people might have lived there. This is because there is a lot of natural salt there. In 1846, Johann Georg Ramsauer (a salt miner) found a cemetery from the neolithic age just above the village. A cultural epoch in Europe is named after this. It is called Hallstatt culture. Other finds in the region include a Shoe-last celt (a special kind of wedge, probably used to treat wood). A blacksmith site has also been excavatzed.

The Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) is a Loyalist paramilitary (civilians trained as soldiers) group formed in 1966. It takes its name from the UVF of World War I. The Ulster Volunteer Force was started as a Protestant/Unionist militia (citizen military force) in 1912 to oppose the Home Rule campaign for a separate Irish parliament. Many UVF members formed the 36th (Ulster) Division that fought with the British Army in World War I. The Progressive Unionist Party is the political wing of the outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force and Red Hand Commando. Although the PUP is called a loyalist fringe party, it has more moderate unionist views than any of the traditional unionist parties.

An artificial or constructed language (sometimes called a conlang) is a language that has been designed by a person or small group, rather than produced naturally as part of a culture. Some are designed for use in human communication (like the well-known Esperanto). Others are created for use in fiction, linguistic experiments, secret codes, or simply because the maker likes to play language games.
Constructed languages can be split into a priori languages, which are made from scratch, and a posteriori languages, which borrow words and grammar from existing languages.
Some constructed languages also have constructed scripts to write them.

Central Florida is the central region of the United States state of Florida, on the East Coast. The region enjoys a hot but stormy climate, with many thunderstorms, and hurricanes threatening often.
The exact boundry of the area may be in dispute. Central Florida tends to be thought of as the area around metropolitan Orlando, including Orange, Osceola, Seminole, Lake, Brevard, and Volusia counties. Polk, Flagler, and Sumter counties are considered by some, including the local media, to be part of Central Florida. Although geographically in the central part of the state, usually the west central coast, including Hillsborough, Pinellas, Pasco, and Hernando counties, is considered the Tampa Bay area or the Suncoast, rather than a part of Central Florida. This area is known as the I-4 corridor.
In 2007, the guessed total population of the Central Florida area was just over 3.8 million people. Central Florida is a mix of deep south and typical Floridian culture. This is what makes the area unique.
The largest cities in Central Florida are Orlando, Palm Bay, Lakeland, Melbourne, Deltona, Daytona Beach, Kissimmee, Altamonte Springs and Sanford.
The region has grown over the last two decades. A lack of growth management has led to massive urban sprawl in the area. Outdated and unplanned building has led to an overload of vehicle traffic. Local governments, in dispute with each other over growth, have now started taking a more regional approach and several transportation programs.

Sir Francis Bacon KC was an English philosopher, statesman, and author. He was knighted in 1603. He was made Baron Verulam in 1618, and Viscount St Albans in 1621. Because he didn't have children both titles ended when he died.
He was born on 22 January 1561 and died on 9 April 1626.
His first job was a lawyer. He became best known as a leading thinker in new ways of looking at the world. His writings started and made famous a way of thinking about science. This way of thinking is now called the "Baconian method". It is based on looking at the world by making experiments. After watching the results the scientist comes up with an idea to explain what has happened. This idea or hypothesis is then further tested by experiments. This way of thinking about science is called inductive methodology. In Bacon's time these methods were linked with magic including hermeticism and alchemy. Alchemy was the study of fire, earth, water and air. Alchemists tried to make gold from lead.

A business is a method of organizing work, where one or more people offer to sell goods or services to other people, for more money than it costs them to make or give it.
The difference covers money for possible risks and for the company's profit. The profit is divided into two parts.
The number of people who work for a business can be as low as one, such as a barber shop in a small community, or as many as hundreds of thousands of people all over the world, such as a company that makes automobiles.
Some businesses do not need a fixed location, such as an office or a store. A carpenter or electrician who works for himself usually brings everything they need for work in their truck, and fishermen who stay out at sea work out of their boats.
"Business" can also mean the work or current state of the business, as in "doing business" or "business is good".

Haskovo is a town in southeastern Bulgaria. Around 96,000 people live there. It celebrated the 1,000th anniversary in 1985.

Archeologists (people who study stuff from long ago) say that people started to live in the Haskovo area about 7,000 years ago.
During the 9th century, a fortress was built, and soon after, a town was built around the fortress. The town was located on a big piece of land between the Klokotnitsa, Harmanliyska, and Maritsa rivers.
In 1395, the "Eski camii" (the Old Mosque) was built as one of the first in the Balkans.
In 1782, the town was known as Marsa (Arab name).
Most Bulgarians started living in Haskovo in the 19th century. The town was a trading center for merchants (people who sell stuff) from Edirne, Enos, and Istanbul. The area became known for producing cotton, silk fabrics, and carpets.

Surveying is the technique and science of accurately determining the position of points and the distances and angles between them. These points are usually, but not exclusively, associated with positions on the surface of the Earth, and are often used to establish land maps and boundaries for ownership or governmental purposes.
In order to reach their objective, surveyors use elements of geometry, engineering, trigonometry, mathematics, physics, and law.
Surveying has been an essential element in the development of the human environment since the beginning of recorded history (ca. 5000 years ago) and it is a requirement in the planning and execution of nearly every form of construction. Its most familiar modern uses are in the fields of transport, building and construction, communications, mapping, and the definition of legal boundaries for land ownership.

Surveying techniques have existed throughout much of recorded history. In ancient Egypt, when the Nile River overflowed its banks and washed out farm boundaries, boundaries were re-established through the application of simple geometry. The nearly perfect squareness and north-south orientation of the Great Pyramid of Giza, built c. 2700 BC, affirm the Egyptians' command of surveying.

is a classic work of Japanese literature believed to have been written by the Japanese noblewoman Murasaki Shikibu at the beginning of the 11th century, around the highest point of the Heian Period. The form of the language used at that time is called Late Old Japanese. "The Tale of Genji" is sometimes called the world's first novel, the first modern novel, or the first novel to still be considered a classic, but many readers do not agree on this.
The first translation of part of "Genji Monogatari" into English was by Suematsu Kencho. Arthur Waley made a free translation of the work, except for one chapter. Edward Seidensticker made the first complete translation into English, using a more literal way than Waley. The most recent English translation, by Royall Tyler (2002), also tries to respect the original text.

A hit record is a recording (either a single or an album) that becomes very popular, through large sales of copies, repeated airplay, or presence in the media. One aspect usually promotes one or more of the others.
The Beatles, Elvis Presley, The Eagles and Michael Jackson all had many hit records. They are among the biggest-selling musical acts of all time. Not every recording artist has a hit record. Many artists and groups lose their recording contracts, if their records do not become hits.
Not all hit records feature music. Some spoken word records also become hits, including comedy recordings. Bill Cosby, George Carlin, and Cheech & Chong are comedians who have all had hit records. A recording of speeches by the late American President John F. Kennedy became one of the biggest-selling albums of the 1960s.

Area is the amount of space a two dimensional (flat) object takes up. It is useful because it is how much of a material is needed to make a hollow container; for example, how much wood is needed to make a wardrobe.
Different shapes have different ways to find the area.
The area of a flat object is related to the surface area and volume of a three-dimensional object.
The area under a curve can be found using integration, from calculus.
Some units used to measure area are square mile and square kilometre.

The Commonwealth is a name for some countries which were part of the British Empire before they became independent. This group of states works together on many important matters, like business, health and the fight against poverty.
The Commonwealth of Nations is a group of countries. Originally, it was called the British Commonwealth of Nations which was founded in 1926 when the British Empire began to break-up. Now, there are 53 member countries of the Commonwealth of Nations. All except Mozambique were part of the British Empire. There are some other associations having similar sounding names. For example, the Commonwealth of Australia or the Commonwealth of Independent states. But, the Commonwealth of Nations is different and a separate organization.

The term the Commonwealth of Nations originated in 1884. Lord Rosebery was on a visit to Australia in 1884. At Adelaide he told that over a period of time a number of colonies of the British Empire will become free and many may become more independent. He further told that all of these countries would then become the Commonwealth of Nations. The use of the term continued, though in its present form and in a practical sense the Commonwealth of Nations originated decades later.

Continuum mechanics is a branch of physics (specifically mechanics) where matter is understood as continuous.
This is useful in engineering (especially civil engineering and mechanical engineering) and in physics that deals with deformation of matter. It is important for both: solids "and" fluids (i.e., liquids and gases).
The fact that matter is made of atoms and that it commonly has some sort of heterogeneous "microstructure" is ignored in the simplifying approximation that is used in continuum mechanics.

Halimede is a non-spherical moon of Neptune. It was found by Matthew J. Holman "et al." on August 14, 2002.
Halimede follows a very inclined and very eccentric orbit seen on the image in relation to other non-spherical moons of Neptune.
Halimede is about 62 kilometres in diameter (assuming an albedo of 0.04) and appears neutral (grey) in the visible light.
Given the very similar colour of the moon to that of Nereid together with a high probability (41%) of their collision in the lifespan of the Solar system, it has been suggested that the moon could be a piece of Nereid.
Halimede, or Neptune IX, like many of the farther moons of Neptune, is named after one of the Nereids, the fifty daughters of Nereus and Doris. Before the announcement of its name on February 3, 2007 (IAUC 8802), Halimede was known by the designation S/2002 N 1.

Proselytism is the practice of attempting to convert people to another opinion and, particularly, another religion.
The word "proselytism" comes from the Greek language prefix 'pros' (towards) and the verb 'erchomai' (I come). Historically in the New Testament, the word proselyte meant a person who had converted to the Jewish religion. Though the word proselytism was originally used in Christianity, it is also used to refer to other religions' attempts to convert people to their beliefs or even any attempt to convert people to another point of view, religious or not. Today, the connotations of the word proselytism are often negative.

A complex number is a type of number. With algebra, a person can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Using negative numbers, it is possible to find the "x" in the equation formula_1 for all possible values of "a" and "b".
With multiplication and division, there is a problem. There is no normal number that gives -1 when it is multiplied by itself. In other words, -1 (or any other negative number) has no square root. To solve this problem, mathematicians introduced an "imaginary number" called "i". That imaginary number will give -1 when it is multiplied by itself.
The first mathematicians to have thought of this were probably Gerolamo Cardano and Raffaele Bombelli. They lived in the 16th century. It was probably Leonhard Euler who introduced writing formula_2 for that number.
A complex number can now be written as formula_3, where "a" is called the "real" part of the number, and "b" is called the imaginary part. Usually, the complex number is written as ("a","b"). Both "a" and "b" are real numbers.
A real number can simply be written as formula_4 or ("a",0).
With complex numbers it is possible to do all the four basic calculations as defined in algebra, but also more complicated calculations.

Pelycosaur (meaning "basin lizards") were the earliest, and most primitive synapsids; they were not dinosaurs. These quadrupeds -- animals that walk on four feet -- appeared during the upper Carboniferous and went extinct during the Permian period (before the Triassic period when the dinosaurs evolved).

Pelycosaur began as small, lizard-like animals and evolved into larger, more differentiated type. Some were carnivores, some were herbivores; some had sailbacks like Dimetrodon, some did not. The swamp dwellers had a sprawling gait and were likely ancestors of the therapsids, which led to the mammals.

A truck (lorry in British English) is a vehicle used to transport goods. The word "truck" comes from the Greek word "trochos", which means "wheel".

"Light trucks" are trucks the size of cars. They are used by individuals and also companies. In the United States, a truck is a light truck if it weighs less than 6,300 kg (13,000 lb).

"Medium trucks" are heavier than light trucks but lighter than heavy trucks. In the United States, a truck is a medium truck if it weighs between 6,300 kg (13,000 lb) and 15,000 kg (33,000 lb). Trucks that are used for local delivery and public service (dump trucks, garbage trucks) are normally around this size.

"Heavy trucks" are the heaviest trucks that are allowed on the road. In the U.K. they are known as "lorries".

People who can not see colors well are called color blind. Most color blind people are male.
Colors are sometimes added to food. Food coloring is used to color food.

The Roman Empire ruled much of Europe in ancient history. It became weaker and finally collapsed in 476. When it collapsed, its army stopped working and its communication systems (ways of people in different places talking to each other) also stopped working. This made the people in Europe unable to talk to each other and share news and facts. Because the Roman army had kept peace between different parts of Europe and defended it from other people, and the Roman army had now collapsed, there was much fighting. This time was known as the Dark Ages. A famous person in the Dark Ages was King Arthur of England. We do not know if he was real or just a myth. There is a legend that he stopped the fighting in England and made peace.
After the Dark Ages, there was the Middle Ages. It is called the "middle" ages because it was between ancient history and modern history. It can also be called medieval times. It was a time when Europe was Christian, and the Catholic Church was very powerful. The Middle Ages ended when the Renaissance started. During the Renaissance people began going to school and university more and learning more things. There was less fighting. The printing press was also made. This was a machine that made books easily and quickly. It made it easier for people to read and learn things.This historical time was when the Vikings entered England.

Colorimeter is a device used for colorimetry. It measures the absorbance of different wavelengths of light in a solution. It is used to measure the concentration of a known solute.
Different chemical substances absorb different wavelengths of light. When the concentration of the solute is more, it absorbs more light in a specific wavelength. This is known as Beer-Lambert law.

Different filters are used to select the wavelength of light which the solution absorbs the most. This makes the colorimeter more accurate. Solutions are usually placed in glass or plastic couvettes. The usual wavelengths used are between 400 and 700 nanometers. If it is necessary to use ultraviolet light (below 400 nanometers) then the lamp and filters must be changed.

The output of the colorimeter may be shown in graphs or tables, by an analogue or digital meter. The data may be printed on paper, or stored in a computer. It either shows the amount of light which is absorbed by the solution, or the amount of light which has passed through the solution.

A steam locomotive is a type of steam engine used on railways. It was used a lot between about 1830 and 1970. Afterwards, diesel and electric locomotives were used more often. The first steam locomotive was made by Richard Trevithick for a railway used for moving iron at an ironworks in Wales. A steam locomotive works by burning a fuel like coal in a special space called a firebox. This produces hot gases that rise and go through tubes in a boiler - a large space with water in it. This heats the water, producing steam. The steam is then taken through another tube to a cylinder. The steam then pushes the piston which in turn pushes a metal rod that is connected to the wheels, making the locomotive move. The steam then rises out through the chimney.
Steam locomotives are still today used in many developing countries where the railways have not yet been electrified.

The forehead of humans is the flat space of skin above the eyes, between the eyebrows and where your hair starts to grow. It exists to make room for the brain inside the skull.
A doctor or nurse will often touch someone's forehead to check whether or not they have a fever. This is because of the many blood vessels in the head and face.
In ancient Greece individuals with large foreheads were classified as intellectual because of their incredibly large "brain". Nowadays this is not the case.
According to the OED Forehead can be pronouced either 'forhed' or 'forrid'.

The head of state of a country is its highest leader. However, the head of state may not have very much real power.
In a modern republic the head of state is a president, usually elected by the people or by a parliament. In a monarchy the head of state is the king or queen. Some countries have different systems - for example the head of state of the Vatican City is the Pope.
In a modern monarchy the head of state usually has little real power. Instead the most powerful person is the head of government. This is usually the leader of the political party that wins the most seats in an election. In these cases the king is considered to be the leader of the country, but must always take the decisions that the head of government advises them to make. The king or queen carries out national ceremonies. The United Kingdom works like this, with the Prime Minister heading the state.
A president may be the most powerful person in the country. This is true in the United States. However sometimes there is a head of government as well as a president. The president then acts very much like a king or queen, leaving the real decisions to the head of government. The Republic of Ireland works like this. In Singapore, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara is the head of state.
In older times and some modern countries the head of state has absolute power.

An engine, or motor, is a machine for converting thermal energy into mechanical energy or power to produce force and motion. For example a car (automobile) has an engine which turns the wheels. An engine needs some kind of energy source, like gasoline (petrol), to work.
Cars make use of an internal combustion engine. There are different types of internal combustion engines; such as petrol/gasoline engines, diesel engines, rotary engines, four-stroke as well as two-stroke engines. The first internal combustion engine that worked was built by a German engineer named Nikolas Otto in 1876. Most cars have either four, six or eight cylinder motors. Modern cars, due to gas prices going up, may make use of three cylinders. For the best power, cars may even make use of sixteen cylinder motors.
External combustion also exists. An example is the steam engine where the fuel is burned outside the engine to create steam, which is used within the motor to bring about motion. These engines are commonly used in old boats or trains.

A World War is a war in which most of the countries in the world fight or help.
There have been two World Wars so far, World War I and World War II.
After World War II, many people were afraid that a World War III might start, probably between the United States and the countries of Europe, on one side, and the Soviet Union, and maybe China, on the other side. After World War II, countries had many powerful weapons, including jet bomber airplanes that could carry many powerful bombs fast and far, nuclear weapons (or atomic weapons) which could destroy many buildings and kill many people instantly, and missiles which could carry nuclear weapons to other countries very fast.
This time when many people were afraid that World War III might start was called the Cold War. After the fall of the Soviet Union, people were not as afraid that World War III might begin. However, many countries still have powerful weapons, and still could use them.
Albert Einstein said, "I don't know what weapons countries might use to fight World War III, but wars after that will be fought with sticks and stones" -- because World war III would be so big that it would probably destroy civilization.

A tornado is a tube of spinning air that touches the ground. Wind inside the tornado, spinning very fast, makes tornadoes very dangerous.
Tornadoes mostly happen during very strong thunderstorms called supercell storms. They cause a lot of damage to anything they touch. People die every year from tornadoes.
Tornadoes are ranked on the Fujita scale, from F0 to F5. F0 has the lowest wind speed, and F5 has the highest wind speed.
The United States of America has the most tornadoes every year, but tornadoes can happen in any country. If a tornado is coming, the safest thing to do is go to a basement or a bathroom with no windows. People should never be in a car or a mobile home when there is a tornado near.

Dorah Pass, also spelled and pronounced Durah Pass, connects Badakshan in Afghanistan with Chitral in Pakistan. The Dorah Pass is more than 14,000 feet (4,300 m) high. It crosses the Hindu Kush. It became important during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan because the Soviets were unable to stop the flow of arms and men back and forth across the pass. Almost the entire Munji-speaking population of Afghanistan fled across the border to Chitral during the War in Afghanistan.

The Big Mac Index is an economic index. It compares the purchasing power of two currencies. It looks at how expensive a Big Mac is in different countries.
The Big Mac Index was first written about in "The Economist" magazine in September 1986. They have published the index each year since then. The McDonald's Big Mac was chosen because it is made in a similar way with similar ingredients in many countries around the world.
The exchange rate between two countries can be compared by dividing the price of a Big Mac in one country (in its currency) by the price of a Big Mac in another country (in its currency). This value is then compared with the actual exchange rate. If the rate is lower, then the first currency is under-valued (according to purchasing power parity (PPP) theory) compared with the second currency. Conversely, if the rate is higher, then the first currency is over-valued.

William of Normandy sent up to 700 ships across the English Channel and landed at small town named Pevensey. King Harold, King of England, sent his army south after defeating Harold Hardraada up north,waited in London before marching down his army to do battle with the Normans. What happened next is what is known as the Battle of Hastings. In this battle, the English leader (King Harold) was hacked to death by a group of norman soldiers.

London County Council (LCC) was the principal local government body for the County of London, during its whole existence (1889-1965), and the first London-wide general municipal authority that was directly elected. It covered the area today known as Inner London and was replaced by the Greater London Council. The LCC was the largest, most significant and ambitious municipal authority of its day.

The creation of the LCC in 1889, as part of the Local Government Act 1888, was forced by a succession of scandals involving the Metropolitan Board of Works (MBW), its predecessor, which had not been directly elected. While the Conservative government of the day would have preferred not to create a single body covering the whole of London, their election promise to the Liberal Unionists led them to this policy. A later Government created the 28 metropolitan boroughs as lower tier authorities to replace the various local authorities in 1899; they assumed some powers of the LCC and shared others.
The LCC inherited the powers of its predecessor the MBW, but also had wider authority over matters such as education, city planning and council housing. It took over the functions of the London School Board in 1903, and Dr C W Kimmins was appointed chief inspector of the education department in 1904.

Hippos have big and heavy bodies, and dark grey skin. They also have large tusks that they use to defend themselves from predators.

Hippopotamuses live in Africa. They live in and near fresh water, like lakes and rivers.

Hippopotamuses are herbivores. They live in groups. Sometimes 30 hippopotamuses will live in the same place. In daytime they will sleep in the mud and water, but at night they come out to eat grass.

Ilama is a kind of fruit, and also the name of the tree that it grows on. The trees and fruits can be found in tropical Central America. The name comes from the Spanish tranlsation of the Nahuatl "ilamatzapotl". Its rough translation is 'old woman's sapote'. The name is also applied to a similar fruit, soncoya or "cabeza de negro" ("A. pupurea") which is cultivated as an alternative to the cherimoya. The soncoya is similar in size to the Ilama but grey brown in color with hard bumps on the surface, and orange flesh that tastes like mango or papaw.
The Ilama fruit is delicious when eaten ripe. It is either eaten on the half-shell or scooped out with a tool. The Ilama is usually chilled when served, it is sometimes served with a little cream and sugar to intensify the flavor, or with a drop of lime or lemon juice to bring in a tart and bitter tinge.

A federal republic is a federation of states, with a republican form of central government. It differs from a unitary state in that in a federal republic, the authorities of the state governments cannot be taken back by the central government.
Many countries have a federal republic government; for example, the Federal Republic of Brazil, the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Republic of India, the United Mexican States, the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, and the United States of America. As this list shows, some of these countries use "Federal Republic" in their name, and some do not.

Queanbeyan, New South Wales
Queanbeyan is a city in New South Wales, Australia. It is also the local government area called Queanbeyan City Council. It is very close to the Australian federal capital city of Canberra. It is really now a part of the capital city as it is on the Australian Capital Territory border and is only from Canberra's CBD. The border itself is marked by a railway line. The Queanbeyan River flows through Queanbeyan, near the centre of the city.
There are 36,331 people living in Queanbeyan has a population of 36,331.

The town grew from a farm owned by ex-convict inn keeper, Timothy Beard. It was on the banks of the Molonglo River. The original name was "Quinbean" which means "clear waters".
Queanbeyan became a township in 1838. There were about 50 people living there. Some of the important historic buildings still standing were built in the early days. Traces of gold were found in 1851. There were also some lead and silver mines. Settlers were often robbed by bushrangers including John Tennant, Jacky Jacky, Frank Gardiner and Ben Hall. In 1836, the government decided to build a Post Office at Queanbeyan on the "Limestone Plains"

Hardcore Punk (or "hardcore") is a style of punk music that usually sounds louder, faster and more angry than earlier punk rock music from the 1970s. Hardcore began in the 1980s in North America. Some of the important bands of the genre are Bad Brains, Black Flag, Discharge, Minor Threat, and the Dead Kennedys. Hardcore songs often have more political lyrics (words) than songs from 1970s punk rock.

Hardcore band singers often sing by shouting the words of the song. Hardcore songs often sound like the singer is angry. Hardcore bands use electric guitars, electric bass guitar, drums, and a singer. The electric guitars in hardcore bands are distorted and noisy because the people in the band have changed the guitar strings so they play notes that are lower than those a normal guitar can play.

"Monty Python and the Holy Grail" is the second movie made by Monty Python. It was made in 1975 and was very successful. It is still very popular. It was also made into a musical called "Spamalot".

This is a comedy about King Arthur's search for the Holy Grail. He gathers a group of knights around him. They do not ride horses - instead they clap coconut halves together, to make the sound of a horse galloping. They search for the grail, but keep on getting distracted by peasants (poor farmers) who want to talk about politics, or French knights insulting them.

Freedom of speech is the right to state one's opinions and ideas without being stopped or punished. Sometimes this is also called Freedom of expression.
Most people think freedom of speech is necessary for a democratic government. In countries without free speech, people might be afraid to say what they think. Then, the government does not know what the people want. If it does not know what they want, it cannot respond to their wants. Without free speech, the government does not have to worry as much about doing what the people want. Some people say this is why some governments do not allow free speech: they do not want to be criticised, or they fear there would be revolution if everyone knew everything that was happening in the country.
A well-known liberal thinker, John Stuart Mill thinks that freedom of speech is not as important because everyone should have a right to express him or herself, but because the society they live in should have a right to hear that person's ideas.
Few countries with "free speech" let everything be said. In America, you are not allowed to shout "fire" in a crowded theater if there is no fire, because this might cause people to panic. After World War II, Germany banned some Nazi ideas.

Nevada is one of the United States. Its capital is Carson City. Other big cities are Las Vegas and Reno.

Nevada was originally founded in 1821 as part of the First Mexican Empire. The Mexican Empire turned into the Mexican Republic in 1823, along with Nevada.

Fighting between the United States and Mexico started. They fought over what was to become the Southwestern United States and who would own the land. This was called the Mexican-American War. The war ended in an American defeat in 1848. Nevada later became an American territory in 1861. It was called the "Nevada Territory". This was not all of Nevada as it is today. The eastern part of Nevada was part of "Utah Territory" and the southern part was part of "New Mexico". In 1859 in the Comstock Lode, gold and silver were first discovered. This started a huge growth in mining in the state which Nevada is known for.

On October 31, 1864, now celebrated as "Nevada Day", Nevada was made the 36th state in the United States. It was given the distinct shape resembling a rectangle with a triangle. It was named "Nevada" meaning "snowy land" in Spanish, because it was snowy in the North. Later, on May 5, 1866, Nevada got its current borders because the Pah-Ute County in Arizona was taken as part of Nevada. It is now Clark County, Nevada. It was also agreed upon that the western part of Utah would become Eastern Nevada.

Vomiting, also called puking, is emptying the contents of stomach through mouth. It can be either food or liquid in the stomach. It can be from infection, contaminated food or drink (food poisoning), foul smells or foul-tasting food, the brain being injured, a block in the small intestines so food and liquid cannot go through, too much alcohol or other drugs. Also, people can make themselves vomit (self-induced) which is called purging. Usually people who have eaten or drunk poison are made to vomit any residual poison off.

Grosseto is a town in the central Italian region of Tuscany. It is the capital of the Province of Grosseto. The city is 12km from the Tyrrhenian Sea. It is located in the Maremma near the Ombrone river. Grosseto has a population of 60,000 people. Another 15,000 people live in the area around the city.

Grosseto was one of the main Etruscan cities. The city was under the control of the Aldobrandeschi family. In 1137, the city was captured by German soldiers under the control of Duke Henry X of Bavaria. In 1151, the people of Grosseto agreed to be under the control of Siena. In 1222, the city returned to the Aldobrandeschi. When Siena captured the lands of the Aldobrandeschi in 1244, Grosseto was under their control again. The city tried to free itself in 1266 and 1355 but failed.
Sienese control of the Grosseto lasted until 1559 when Charles V gave control of the city to the Medici. It then became part of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany.

19 Fortuna is one of the biggest main belt asteroids. It is made up of stuff similar to 1 Ceres: a darkly colored surface that is heavily space weathered and made up of primitive organic compounds, including tholins.
Fortuna is 225 km in diameter and has one of the darkest known geometric albedos for an asteroid over 150 km in diameter. Its albedo has been measured at 0.028 and 0.037.
The Hubble Space Telescope saw Fortuna in 1993. It was resolved with an apparent diameter of 0.20 arcseconds (4.5 pixels in the Planetary Camera) and its shape was found to be nearly spherical. Moons were searched for but none were detected.
Stellar occultations by Fortuna have been seen several times.
It was found by J. R. Hind on August 22, 1852 and named after Fortuna, the Roman goddess of luck.

A chinook is a warm westerly wind that sometimes flows over Canada's Rocky Mountains in the winter. It can raise temperatures in southern Alberta by twenty or thirty degrees in an hour. A chinook is caused when air flowing off the Pacific Ocean is raised by the mountains and heated as the water vapor in the air condenses. Then it is warmed more as it flows down the other side of the mountains and is compressed. It flows out over the prairie, and may travel as far as the eastern border of Alberta if it is especially strong. The chinook is also called "snow eater", because it can melt snow so quickly.

The Official Municipality Key, which used to be called the "Official Municipality Characteristic Number" or "Municipality Code Number", is a group of numbers used to tell the difference between different municipalities and areas.

In Germany the Official Municipality Key has statistical goals and is given by the statistics offices of individual German states. The municipality key is given in times like moving house on the notice of some documents.

The municipality key has eight digits, which are set like this: The first two numbers tell people what the German state is. The third number say the government district (in areas without government districts a zero is used instead). The fourth and fifth numbers show people the number of the urban area (in a city without districts) or the district (in a city with districts). The sixth, seventh, and eighth numbers show the municipality or the number of the municipality-free area.

08 1 11 000: Stuttgart
15 3 52 002: Aschersleben

In Austria the municipality key has five digits which are chosen like this: The first number shows the number of the Austrian state, the second and third numbers show the district, and the fourth and fifth numbers show the municipality.

9 07 01: Vienna - Neubau

The Swiss Federal Office for Statistics makes code numbers with up to four digits, which are given in the order chosen with the official order of the cantons, districts, and municipalities in Switzerland.

A metropolitan borough (or metropolitan district) is a type of local government district in England and covers urban areas within metropolitan counties.
Current metropolitan boroughs (post 1974).
The current metropolitan boroughs were created in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972 as subdivisions of the new metropolitan counties which were created to cover the six largest urban areas in England outside Greater London
The new authorities were actually defined by law as metropolitan districts, however all of them have borough status or city status. The new metropolitan boroughs replaced the county boroughs, municipal boroughs and urban and rural districts which existed before. The districts typically have populations of 174,000 to 1.1 million.
In 1986 the old metropolitan county councils were abolished by the Local Government Act 1985 and most of their functions were given to the boroughs, so they are to a large extent unitary authorities. Some of the functions of the abolished county councils were taken over by joint bodies such as Passenger Transport Authorities, and joint fire, police and waste disposal authorities.

Armenia is a country in the Caucasus region of Europe. Its capital city is Yerevan. Armenia received its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.
Armenia touches Turkey, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Iran.
There are some minorities living in Armenia, such as Greek, Russian, and other minorities, and more than 90% of the people are ethnic Armenians. Also, the Armenian Apostolic Church, is by far the largest religion in the country. There are a small amount of other Christians, Muslims and atheists.
Armenia is the place that some Christians believe Noah's Ark landed, and Noah's family settled. The Armenian name for Armenia (Hayastan) means Land of Haik. Haik was the name of a great-great-grandson of Noah.
Throughout history, Armenia's size has changed many times. Today Armenia is much smaller than it was once. In 80 BC, the Kingdom of Armenia covered parts of what is today Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Iran, Iraq, Azerbaijan, and, of course, Armenia.
From 1920 to 1991, Armenia was a Communist country. (Communism is a political idea.) It was a member of the Soviet Union.
Today, Armenia's borders are locked with Turkey and Azerbaijan, due to conflicts. In 1992, Armenia and Azerbaijan had a war over the land of Nagorno-Karabakh. The fighting stopped in 1994, and Armenia has had control over this land, but Azerbaijan still disputes about the land.

Romulus and Remus were the legendary founders of Rome. In Roman mythology they were twin brothers, children of Rhea Silvia and the god Mars.

Rhea Silvia was the daughter of Numitor Silvius, king of Alba Longa, a legendary town founded by Ascagne, son of Aeneas. When Numitor's brother Amulius became king by force, he made Rhea Silvia a Vestal Virgin, so she would not have children who could be kings instead of him. But the god Mars seduced her and she had the twins Romulus and Remus. Rhea Silvia was punished, and her sons were thrown into the Tiber, but were saved by the river god Tiberinus, who also saved Rhea Silvia and married her. Romulus and Remus were found by a wolf who suckled them. The brothers were later found by a farmer who raised them.

Romulus and Remus founded the city of Rome. But Romulus killed Remus in a fight and he went back to Amulius's palace and killed him.

A flash (also known as a "tattoo flash") is a design or picture that is used in order to create a tattoo. They often come in sets like a poster (called flash sheets), and can be seen in most tattoo shops.
Tattoo flashes are often drawn for general use, rather than being a custom made piece like some personal tattoos. However, some flashes have space for personalisation, for example space for the person to include a name in their tattoo.
Tattoo flashes come in a variety of different designs, and are divided into categories such as celtic, heart, arm band tattoos e.t.c. A person wanting a tattoo made from a flash chooses which design they like best. Then the tattooist uses a stencil to draw the basic design onto the skin of the person being tattooed, and afterwards starts to make the tattoo.

"The Da Vinci Code" is a 2003 book by an American man named Dan Brown. It is about codes and secrets. The book is very famous and has been read by many people all over the world. As of 2006, over 60 million people had bought copies, which makes this book one of the most famous books in the world. There are many things in the book that are hard to understand, and it is hard to tell which parts of the book are about real things, and which parts are not true. Because of this, people like to talk about the book, which makes more people buy copies.
The book talks about a religious group called Opus Dei, a famous artist named Leonardo da Vinci, and some famous paintings he made called the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper.
According to Sharan Newman in "The Real History behind the Da Vinci Code", Dan Brown based "The Da Vinci Code" on a book called "Holy Blood, Holy Grail" by Baigent and Leigh. This book was based on some papers found in the National Library of France, and which were forgeries. The papers were written to show that the man who wrote them was really the true king of France and head of an ancient secret society.
In 2006, Columbia Pictures made a movie version. It was directed by Ron Howard and stars Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon.

Graph Theory is about analyzing Graphs. A graph is a group of points and lines connecting each other, to make a picture of such a route. It is less detailed than a map and is used to find answers.

Graph theory is an important part of mathematics and computer science. To many such problems, exact solutions do exist. Many times however, they are very hard to calculate. Therefore, very often, approximations are used. There are two kinds of such approximations, Monte-Carlo algorithms and Las-Vegas algorithms.
Graphs are normally represented by two different sets, typically set a graph G would be represented as the collection of the sets V and E. The set V is a discrete set containing all vertices of the graph. The set E is a binary set, whose pairwise elements are elements of set V. Each pair in set E represents an edge connecting two vertices.
If for all elements v1 and v2 of the set V, if and are both elements of E then the graph G is considered a Complete Graph.
I would move forth to define a Path, a Walk, A weighted graph, a directional graph. Then make a comment about how all trees are just subsets of graphs. It could also be proven that all connected graphs may be represented as a Tree. There is more to graph theory than explained here.

Investiture means the formal installation of somebody (heir, elect of nominee) in public office by formally giving him the "insignia". The term is normally reserved for formal offices of state, aristocracy and church.
In the Middle Ages investiture was the ceremonial transfer of a fief by an overlord to a vassal. The lord "invested" the vassal with a fiefdom, by giving a symbol of the land or office. From feudal times up to the present, the term has been used in ecclesiastical law to refer to a cleric receiving the symbols of spiritual office, such as the pastoral ring, mitre and staff, signifying transfer of the office.

In the United Kingdom, around 2,600 people are invested personally by The Queen or a member of the Royal Family. A list of those to be honoured is published twice a year, in either the New Year's Honours List or The Queen's Birthday Honours List.
Approximately 22 Investitures are held annually in Buckingham Palace, one or two at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh and one in Cardiff.

The question who should invest (or more to the point, appoint) whom was the subject of a conflict between the Catholic church (mainly papacy) and state (mainly the Holy Roman Empire) in the Middle Ages during the so-called Investiture Controversy (see that article).

Standard deviation is a concept from statistics. It tells how the values are grouped around the mean. It is the average of a set of numbers' difference from the mean.

Standard deviation can be used to evaluate the precision or consistency of a set of data. Standard deviation can also produce standard error, which is useful in statistical inference.

To find the standard deviation of the numbers 3, 7, 7, and 19.
Step 1: find the mean of 3, 7, 7, and 19
Step 2: find the deviation of each number from the mean,
Step 3: square each of the deviations
Step 4: find the mean of those squared deviations
Step 5: find the square root
So, the standard deviation is 6.

Penelope is a person in Greek mythology. She is the wife of Odysseus of Ithaca and mother of Telemachos. She became a symbol for the faithful wife.
When her husband Odysseus was on his long journey home, many people thought he was dead. Because of this many suitors came who wanted to marry Penelope, because then they would own her land and wealth, and become king of Ithaca.
Penelope thinks of several tricks so that she does not have to marry one of the suitors. One trick is that she tells the suitors that she will first weave a cloth for the funeral of Odysseus' father, and when she was finished she would marry one of the suitors. But every night she undoes her weaving again, so that she never finishes it.

Plutonium is a chemical element. It is a higly radioactive metal. It has the chemical symbol Pu. It has the atomic number 94. It is the metal used in most atomic weapons now. The chemical element plutonium has some different isotopes. The most important isotope of plutonium is 239Pu (or plutonium-239). Plutonium-239 has a half-life (a half-life is how long it takes for half of something to decay) of 24,110 years. It can be made from natural uranium and is fissile. The isotope that has the longest half-life is 244Pu (or plutonium-244). Plutonium-244 has a half-life of about 80 million years. The half life of 244Pu is very long so some of this isotope of plutonium can be found in very small amounts in nature.

Actuaries are people who are experts in mathematics, probability, economics, and finance who figure out how much money businesses should charge for making promises to pay for something that may or may not happen.

Hundreds of years ago, when people got sick or died, it cost a lot of money to take care of them or bury them. People had the idea of joining their money together to help each other out. This was called pooling. Eventually, people started to make a business out of collecting enough money to help people who had big problems.
Figuring out how much money needed to be collected from people to be used if problems happened was not easy. Over hundreds of years, the math needed for this was developed by many people from all over the world.
Today, actuaries use computers to figure out problems that were too difficult before.

Actuaries now work in many places. Most work for insurance companies, but others work in all kinds of finance companies. Actuaries still figure out how much money needs to be paid for life insurance, as well as other kinds of money promises, like pensions, car insurance, house insurance, and similar.
Actuaries also work with companies to figure out if making certain business deals are a good idea, since actuaries work with figuring out what the probabilities are of different business situations happening.

People who want to be actuaries need to take many tests. The tests are not the same in different parts of the world.

The Bill of Rights is the name for the first 10 amendments to the United States Constitution, which limited the power of the federal government and guaranteed citizens of the United States certain rights. The amendments were written in 1789 by James Madison, and were based on important ideas about personal rights. The Bill of Rights went into effect in 1791, when 3/4 of the states agreed that they were fair. Originally, the Bill of Rights had 12 different amendments, but the first two were not passed by enough states. The second amendment that was omitted was eventually added to the Constitution in 1992. It is now the 27th Amendment to the Constitution, and deals with pay changes for the government.

"Congress shall make no law regarding an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof..."
"...or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press..."
"...or of the right of the people to peaceably assemble..."
"...and to petition the government for redress of grievances."

Jerk is the change in the acceleration of an object. Mathematically, jerk is the derivative, or the rate of change in acceleration by time. Jerk is also called jolt (in British English), surge, or lurch. Jerk is a vector and there is no word for its scalar value.
The jerk is measured in metres per second cubed (formula_1).
Yank can be thought as a force in terms of jerk. Force is mass times acceleration. Similarly, Yank is mass times jerk. It is also the derivative of the force. However, when an object is moving near the speed of light, a force is often written as the derivative of momentum. In this case, Yank is the rate of change of derivative of momentum.

Jerk is used in engineering, more than ever in making roller coasters. Weak objects such as people can be damaged by high acceleration or high jerk.
Also, jerk must be thought in the process of making any product. Sudden change in acceleration means very large jerk. This leads to a tool to be damaged faster.

Jerk is also a mean name to call a mean person, or an idiom for ugly behaviour.

In Sufism there exist many different orders ("tarikas"), that were founded from the 12th and 13th centuries until today.
The goal in Sufism is to reach God not only in the hereafter, but in this world. To reach this goal, Sufis practice an ascetic lifestyle, and perform "dhikr", a kind of prayer to God. Often they perform it in a congregation, and each Sufi order has its own special kind of "dhikr".

A Sertoli cell is a cell found in the testes. Its main function is to help the developing sperm cells through the stages of spermatogenesis - the process of turning stem cells into sperm. It was also called the "mother cell." The cell also helps in the creation of stem cells.

Sertoli cells get their name from Enrico Sertoli, an Italian physiologist. He discovered them while studying medicine in the University of Pavia, Italy. He published a description of this cell in 1865. As of 2006, two textbooks have been published that are almost entirely about the Sertoli cell.

"Mulan" is a 1998 animated movie from Walt Disney Pictures, set in old-time China and based on local legend. It stars the voices of Ming-Na Wen as the title heroine, along with Eddie Murphy.
Mulan was a success with its fans, as the movie was different from Disney's usual fare in terms of music and artistic design.
The music was written by Jerry Goldsmith who also wrote the music for another animated movie, 1982's "The Secret of NIMH". Christina Aguilera sang "Reflections" for the movie's soundtrack.
A direct-to-video sequel, "Mulan II", came out on February 1,2005 in the United States and on November 3, 2004 in Italy and Norway.

Dance Dance Revolution is a series of video games made by Konami in which players step on arrows on a large pad or mat to match the arrows on screen. The arrows are in time with the music. Because players are moving themselves along to the music, they look like they are dancing. There is a large variety of music.
There is a bar at the top of the screen. If players make mistakes, the bar gets smaller. If players do not make mistakes, the bar grows. The game ends if the player makes too many mistakes.
Players can choose between three levels. They are called light, standard, and heavy. Light is easy and heavy is hard. On some of the newer games, there is a beginner mode, which is very easy, and a challenge mode, which is very hard.
From DDR SuperNOVA to later versions, the levels are called beginner, basic, difficult, expert, and challenge.

Wit is a form of intellectual humour. A wit is someone skilled in making witty remarks. A witty remark is an incisive observation, put with humor and said in the perfect moment. Forms of wit include: the quip and the repartee.
Witty remarks may be intentionally cruel, and perhaps more ingenious than funny.
A quip is an observation or saying that has some wit but perhaps descends into sarcasm, or otherwise is short of point; a witticism also suggests the diminutive. Repartee is the wit of the quick answer. (Wilde: "I wish I'd said that." Whistler: "You will, Oscar, you will".)

Electrolysis is a scientific way of "splitting" substances. Electrolysis means "electric-splitting".

Electrolysis is used in the mining industry to split reactive metals from their ores after they are extracted (taken) from the ground. It is also used to plate (cover) things with metal because it costs less than using, for example, 100% pure solid gold to make jewelry.
Many beauty companies use electrolysis to remove hair. This is done by "electrocuting" the hair so it splits along its root. This is usually done around the bikini line and genital area.

A metal is melted so it is easier to get the important part. It is then treated with an electric current so that the metal splits from anything else that was contaminating it, usually a non metal like sulphur or oxygen.
Electric current has two "ends", a positive and a negative. The positive end in an electrolysis is called the anode. The impurity goes towards that. The negative end is called the cathode and the metal (the important bit) goes to that side. When "go" is used it does not actually mean that the molten metal, the solution, splits down the middle. The metal part of the solution, called an ion, goes to the anode. They do this because the ions have a charge which is opposite to the end they go to. Metals have a positive charge and most non metals are negatively charged so that they split.

Electrolysing water gives hydrogen gas and oxygen gas. This is strange as water is a liquid.

Division by Zero is a problem of number theory that does not allow a number to be divided by zero. It is a rule of mathematics.
With the equation formula_1, if "A" and "B" are both known, "C" can be calculated. This is called multiplication.
If "C" and "A" are known, "B" can be calulated by using division.
Here, "A" can not be solved for since any number times zero is equal to zero. If "A" were 3 then the statement would be correct that "A" * "B" = "C", but it would also be correct if "A" were 5 or 55, or any other number. Therefore, it is not allowed to divide by zero, because the result is undefined.

A hurley is a wooden stick measuring between 70 and 100 cm (26 to 40 inches) long with a flattened, curved end (called the "bas"), used to hit a "sliotar" (leather ball) in the Irish sport of hurling. It is also used in camogie, the female equivalent, and there often called a camogie stick.
Hurleys are made from ash wood, and are usually bought from local craftsmen in Ireland, who still use traditional production methods.
No matter how well crafted the hurley is, a hurler may well expect to use several hurleys over the course of the hurling season. The hurleys often break if two collide in the course of a game, or occasionally they break off on the other players (arms, legs, etc.). Two hurleys colliding is colloquially known as "the clash of the ash." Throwing the hurley (e.g. to block a ball going high over one's head) is illegal, but camogie players may drop it to make a handpass.

Social psychology is the study of how people and groups interact. Scholars in this interdisciplinary area are typically either psychologists or sociologists, though all social psychologists employ both the individual and the group as their units of analysis.
Despite their similarity, psychological and sociological researchers tend to differ in their goals, approaches, methods, and terminology. They also favor separate academic journals and professional societies. The greatest period of collaboration between sociologists and psychologists was during the years immediately following World War II. Although there has been increasing isolation and specialization in recent years, some degree of overlap and influence remains between the two disciplines.

Romanization or "Latinization" is the process by which words and languages that normally use alphabets other than the Latin alphabet are converted into Latin letters so that people who do not know the original alphabet can still read the sounds of the language. It is one way to show pronunciation of words from a non-Latin writing system.

Transcription occurs when the effect at the end is that both the original and the transcripted version sound the same, whether or not each letter alone in one text matches the corresponding letter in the other one.

Transliteration occurs when the effect at the end is for the letters to match one to one, whether or not the sound is the same.

A dive bomber is a bomber aircraft that dives towards the ground so it can get very close to its targets. This means it is more likely to hit them. This can also limit the chance of anti-aircraft fire.
Diving nearly vertically at the target, in the same direction the bombs will take, the aircraft will release the bombs very close to the target at high speed. This allows a dive bomber to accurately place bombs on relatively small target, or a moving target quite easily. Additionally, no complicated precision equipment is needed. Dive bombers were widely used to attack high value targets such as ships and bridges. This also had the advantage of attacking ships at a weak spot; armour was the heaviest near the waterline and thin or non-existent on the deck. Also, dive bombing allowed relatively small aeroplanes carrying limited bomb load to produce more damage than usual.

In music the word composition can be used in two ways.
A composition is a piece of music (the word "composition" means "putting together", so a composition is something where music notes have been put together). When a composer writes a piece of music he or she is composing a musical composition.
The word "composition" can also mean: learning the skill of how to compose. Music students may go to music college to study composition. They will do this by looking at famous pieces of music to see how the composers of the past wrote music. They will study musical form, harmony, orchestration, counterpoint and learn about all the instruments and how to write well for them so that it sounds nice.

Dioxins is the name for a group of chemical compounds. These are organic compounds. Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs), or simply dioxins, are a group of halogenated organic compounds which are significant because they act as environmental pollutants. They are very poisonous. Many dioxins cause cancer.
Today, Dioxins are no longer made. They can occur as a by-product of other processes, though. Examples where dioxins can result are the production of PVC or the bleaching of paper. In nature, they are produced in volcanoes and forest fires.
A chemical accident where a lot of dioxin was released was the Seveso disaster.

The Short Parliament in English history lasted from April 13 to May 5 1640. It is called "Short" because it only lasted for three weeks.
Charles I of England, who was also king of Scotland, was having problems with the Church of Scotland and war with them was breaking out again. Charles had spent the last 11 years ruling directly, without calling a Parliament even once. He did this because he had little use for elected representatives trying to decide policy. But now with the problems with the Scots, Charles needed money to pay for his war. To get more money for war meant he had to call a Parliament so they could vote on it.
The problem was that the members of Parliament were unhappy about the things he had done since 1629, when he was ruling without them. They wanted to talk about these things instead of giving the king his money. John Pym, member for Tavistock, gave fiery speeches refusing to give money unless the abuses were talked about. Charles responded by closing the Parliament and sending them home again, and he tried to fight the Scots without the money. But when this did not work and as a result of his defeat had to agree to pay the Scots, he was forced to call Parliament again. This became known as the Long Parliament, and the Constitutional crisis that followed led to the bloody English Civil War.

Perspective works by representing the light that passes from a scene through an imaginary rectangle (the painting), to the viewer's eye. It is similar to a viewer looking through a window and painting what is seen directly onto the windowpane. If viewed from the same spot as the windowpane was painted, the painted image would be identical to what was seen through the unpainted window. Each painted object in the scene is a flat, scaled down version of the object on the other side of the window.

Tomorrow Never Knows is a song from The Beatles's "Revolver" album, from 1966.
John Lennon wrote the song based on his readings of "The Psychedelic Experience", which adapted the "Tibetan Book of the Dead" for use as an LSD "user's manual", intending to give users a kind of religious experience. The song's title came from his bandmate Ringo Starr, who was known for his quirky but insightful comments about life.
Lennon wanted the sound of monks chanting, to complement the Beatles' recording of the song. It was not possible to do this, but Lennon's voice was played through a special speaker (called a Leslie speaker), to give it a warbling sound, like a voice calling from a hilltop. Other sounds on the record came from tape loops, playing over and over, and from a sitar.
The song has also been recorded by other artists. A dance cover version appeared in the 1990s.

Moral reasoning is a topic studied in psychology and in moral philosophy. It studies how people think about moral issues, problems, and questions. Psychologists who have studied it include Lawrence Kohlberg and Elliot Turiel. Kohlberg said that moral understanding develops in three main stages as a person gets older, but Turiel said that there are three domains of moral understanding that develop at the same time as a person gets older.
Moral philosophy, or ethics, is a major branch of philosophy. It is the study of value or quality. It covers the analysis and use of concepts such as right, wrong, good, evil, and responsibility.

Phrasal verb is the name given to an English verb which is composed of two or three words. One verb is combined with a preposition (like "on, in, under)" or an adverb (like "up, down, away"). Sometimes a phrasal verb can have a meaning that is very different to the meaning of at least one of those two or three words separately. Some text books call these verbs multi-word verbs. Phrasal verbs are used more frequently in everyday speech than in formal, official writing or speaking.
"Maria didn't know the word, so she" looked it up "in the dictionary."
"Oh no, we've" run out of "milk! I'll have to buy some more."
"Farmers have to" get up "early in the morning."
"The rocket" took off "with a loud roar."
Often these phrasal verbs have a one-word equivalent in other languages.
In Spanish, to get up can be translated as "levantarse", in French as "se lever" etc.
Many students of English as a foreign language panic when they hear the term "phrasal verbs", but in fact phrasal verbs are just vocabulary to memorize, and not some strange, secret grammatical formula. In fact many native speakers of English do not know the term "phrasal verb" at all, even though they probably use them very often!

There are four different types of phrasal verbs.
Instead of "separate" or "separable", some text books use the word "split" or "splittable".
If you do not know if a phrasal verb is separable or inseparable ALWAYS use a noun or noun phrase and do not try to separate the verb.

A sleeping pill (people also call it sedative) is a drug that people take to help them sleep. It will relax them, and make them very calm.
Some sedatives can act very fast, like in 10-15 minutes. Those who consider taking sedatives should talk with their doctor, who can give them the sedatives which are best for them.
Most sedatives are highly addictive, so people need a prescription from their doctor to get sedatives.
If they take sleeping pills for a longer time, they can get addicted. Getting rid of the addiction is very hard to do. Addiction means that people who take the drug cannot stop taking it, without bad consequences (as described below). It's like people who want to stop smoking, but who cannot.
Some people are addicted to sedatives. When they stop taking the sedatives, they may experience the following
Some addictions can also be psychological; when the users stop taking the drug, they may feel depressed.

A Guild is an association of craftspeople. Several people in the same craft or trade got together and formed a guild. That way it was easier for them to stand up for their interests, for example in politics. They maybe watched other people who did the same job to make sure that they didn't cheat any customers. The earliest guilds were probably formed in India around 3800 BC. Being a member of a guild was a privilege, which had to be gained.
Guilds were common place in the cities of the Middle Ages. After that, around 1700 to 1800 their influence lessened. Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Adam Smith very very much opposed to the idea of guilds. They believed that guilds hindered economic development and free trade.

Musicology means the study of music by a scholar. A scholar is an academic person, often a professor or lecturer at a university. Someone who studies musicology is a Musicologist.
Musicologists study all kinds of music. They study the history of music and learn about all the composers and how they developed their ideas and learned from one another. They can do this by studying music scores, or by looking for historical documents which tell us about musicians from the past. Musicologists may also study the philosophy of music (thinking about what music means).
They write articles in musical journals or books on music. This can help us to know and understand more about the music we play or listen to.

Crickets, family Gryllidae (also known as "true crickets"), are insects somewhat related to grasshoppers and more closely related to katydids or bush crickets (family Tettigoniidae). They have somewhat flattened bodies and long antennae. There are about 900 species of crickets. They tend to be nocturnal and are often confused with grasshoppers because they have a similar body structure including jumping hind legs.

Crickets are known for their chirp (which only male crickets can do; male wings have ridges or "teeth" that act like a "comb and file" instrument). The left forewing has a thick rib (a modified vein) which bears 50 to 300 "teeth". The chirp is made by raising their left forewing to a 45 degree angle and rubbing it against the upper hind edge of the right forewing, which has a thick scraper (Berenbaum 1995). This sound producing action is called "stridulation" and the song is species-specific. There are two types of cricket songs: a calling song and a courting song. The calling song attracts females and repels other males, and is fairly loud. The courting song is used when a female cricket is near, and is a very quiet song.
Crickets are hermaphrodites in their childhood.:)

In anatomy, the atlas is the top "cervical vertebra" (neck bones) of the spine. In anatomy, the "atlas" is written (C1) for short.
It is named for the Atlas of mythology, because it supports the head in the same way as Atlas held the world on his shoulders.
The "atlas" connects to a vertebra called the Axis. Together they form the joint connecting the skull to the rest of the spine. The "atlas" and "axis" are different in shape from all the other vertebrae. They have more movement. They allow the head to nod and to rotate (turn).

High-definition television (HDTV) is a new television broadcasting system which uses a higher resolution than a normal television. With HDTV we can watch television in higher quality than old television, giving a more vivid and clear screen.
Most HDTV systems use digital signals. And HDTV has a 16:9 aspect ratio. This is different than SDTV (standard-definition television) which uses analog signals and a 4:3 aspect ratio.
HDTV picture resolution is at least twice that of SDTV, so it can present a more vivid screen than analog television or DVD. HDTV can control resolution efficiently.

The Semantic Web is a project of the W3C in which uses metadata to let computers understand the information on the internet. This would make computers able to do more of the work involved in finding, sharing and combining information on the internet.
The Semantic Web is an idea of the inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners Lee. He wants to make the web more intuitive about how to meet a user's needs. The semantics of information and services is defined in Web Ontology Language and RDF Schemas. These are used to give a formal description of concepts, terms, and relationships within a given area of knowledge.

The World Wide Web is based on HTML documents. The semantic web involves using Resource description Framework (RDF) that has data that computers use. The layout used in HTML will be stored separately such as in a CSS file. RDF and OWL can either supplement or replace the content of web documents (XHTML).
In this way a machine can use the knowledge itself. By using the information in ways similar to human reasoning it can create more meaningful results.

Ruins are the parts of buildings that are left after they have been destroyed and cannot be properly used any more. Many ruins are ancient and famous like the ruins of the forum of Ancient Rome, or the ruins of Tintagel Castle on the coast of Cornwall. Ruins can be caused by wars or by natural disasters such as earthquakes, fires and volcanos. Sometimes people leave a house or a village to stand empty, and move somewhere else. When this happens, the house or village slowly becomes a ruin.

Historic ruins are often a good place for archaeologists to search for evidence of the way people used to live. Often the ruins have all sorts of interesting things buried in them. Archaeologists call the things that they find "artefacts". Artefacts might include beautiful artworks, jewellry and gold coins but usually they are ordinary things like cooking pots, mugs, spoons, hair combs, pipes, old shoes, broken toys and rats' nests. Historians use the evidence found by the archaeologists to write about the place and what might have happened there.
Other people who find ruins very interesting are artists. Many artists have drawn or painted pictures of ruined buildings. In the 18th and 19th centuries, pictures of ruins became very popular.

Oneness Pentecostalism is a protestant Christian movement. The movement split from the Pentecostal movement. Followers believe that the bible should be read literally. They believe in one god, and reject ideas like the Trinity. Jesus is fully god and flully human. This makes them different from most Unitarians who say that the son of god was only man. Oneness Pentecostalists say the belief in the trinity is really the belief in three different gods. The 10 Commandments say there is only one god, so Trinity is wrong.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is an agency of the United States Department of Transportation with authority to regulate and oversee all aspects of civil aviation in the U.S. The Federal Aviation Act of 1958 created the group under the name "Federal Aviation Agency", and adopted its current name in 1967 when it became a part of the United States Department of Transportation. The FAA is the single most influential governmentally-run aviation agency in the world, with the European Aviation Safety Agency in a close second.

Mercenaries are soldiers who fight mainly for money, rather than for their country or for their political beliefs.
For many years in the Middle Ages soldiers from Switzerland fought battles for which ever side paid them. The popes would hire soldiers from Switzerland to fight for them. The Swiss Guard is all that is left of Switzerland's mercenary tradition. However the modern Swiss Guard are not mercenaries, because the guards are all catholic and are prepared to fight not for their country but for their beliefs.
In 2004, Sir Mark Thatcher was arrested in connection with an attempt by mercenaries to take over the country of Equatorial Guinea. Thatcher, son of Margaret Thatcher, the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. He was eventually fined because of his involvement in giving funds to the leaders, but not with planning the fighting.

A Bushfire is a fire that happens in the bush. Bush is the word for scrub, woodland or grassland of Australia and New Zealand. In south east and south west of Australia, bushfires are most common in the summer and early autumn. In the north of Australia, bushfires usually happen during winter which is the dry season.. Many Australian plants burn easily. Eucalyptus trees have a high oil content which makes them burn. Over the last 40 years, Australian bushfires have cost A$2.5 billion. In the same period, Australian bushfires caused the death of around 250 people and the destruction of 4,554 homes.

182 Elsa is a Main belt asteroid. It is an S-type asteroid.
It was found by Johann Palisa on February 7, 1878. What it is named after is uncertain; it may be named after the character in the legend of Lohengrin perpetuated by Richard Wagner's opera of the same name.
It rotates very slowly; its rotation period (or "day") is about 3.3 Earth days. A possible moon has been suggested to explain the slow rotation.
Elsa has very amplified lightcurve indicating a stretched or non-spherical body. It was one of five minor planets included in the 1993 study, Transition Comets -- UV Search for OH Emissions in Asteroids, which was research involving non-professional astronomers who were allowed to make use of the Hubble Space Telescope.

The Voice of America (VOA) is the official broadcasting service of the United States government. It is one of the best-known stations in international broadcasting. Americans in the United States are not part of VOA's intended audience, but many Americans do listen to the programming.
VOA was organized in 1942 under the Office of War Information with news programs aimed at Europe and North Africa occupied by Germany. VOA began broadcasting on February 24, 1942. Transmitters used by VOA came from shortwave transmitters used by the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) and National Broadcasting Company (NBC). Voice of America began to transmit radio broadcasts into the Soviet Union on February 17, 1947.
During the Cold War, VOA was placed under the United States Information Agency. In the 1980s, VOA also added a television service, as well as special regional programs to Cuba, Radio Marti and TV Marti.

Kraftwerk is a pop band from Germany that became famous in the late 1970s and 1980s for making electronic music. They used a synthesizer to make the rhythms and melodies in the song.
Kraftwerk made electronic music many years before other bands knew it would be popular. They paved the way for the MIDI and digital styles of music to become popular in the 1990s. Many of the sounds from songs such as "Computer Love", "We Are Robots",and "Trans Europe Express" can be heard sampled by a variety of bands on their current releases. Recently, some of Kraftwerk's original recording equipment was sold on eBay for astonishing amounts. Kraftwerk continues to have a faithful and much deserved following.

Hurricane Pauline was a destructive hurricane of the 1997 Pacific hurricane season and one of the deadliest.
Pauline formed in the eastern Pacific on October 6. It strengthened rapidly, reaching category four on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale on the next day. After a brief period of weakening to a category three, it re-intensified back to a category four, moving roughly parallel to the Mexican coast.
Pauline then made landfall, slamming into Mexico. Heavy rains and high winds caused damage as the storm skirted the coast.
There were 300-400 deaths, and heavy damage to Acalpulco.
The name was retired and replaced by Patricia for the 2003 Pacific hurricane season.

A driver is a program that lets the operating system communicate with the computer hardware.
Computer parts need a driver because they do not use standard commands. (Ex.: ATI and Nvidia graphic cards do the same jobs, but not the same way). Different operating systems also need different drivers, a driver written for Linux can not be used by Microsoft Windows.
Some other parts do not need drivers because they use a kind of standard; the operating system recognizes those parts and knows how to use those parts.

Using the wrong device driver can prevent hardware from operating correctly. For example, a HP printer will not work with a computer that only has an Canon driver. Keeping drivers up-to-date avoids problems when using new programs (such as Windows Vista) with the piece of hardware.

A burrow is a hole or tunnel that was dug into the ground by an animal to create a space that can be used for living or short time shelter. The burrowing way of life is quite popular among the animals.
Many animals construct or use burrows in many different types. Mammals are perhaps most well-known for burrowing, especially Insectivora like the voracious mole, and rodents like the fertile gopher and groundhog. The rabbit, a member of the family Lagomorpha, is a well-known burrower. There are estimations that a single groundhog burrow occupies a full cubic meter, displacing 320 kilograms of dirt. Even Carnivora like the meerkat and Marsupials like the kangaroo mouse are burrowers.
Burrows can be constructed into a wide variety of substrates. Kangaroo mice construct burrows in fine sand. Termites construct burrows in wood. Some sea urchins and clams can burrow into rock. Burrows can also range in complexity from a simple tube a few centimeters long to a complex network of interconnecting tunnels and chambers hundreds or thousands of meters in total length, such as a well-developed rabbit warren.

A Padded cell is a special room in a hospital for mentally ill people. It made so that the patients can be put there when they go through a crisis (or they have a fit or seizure). They are put there so they can go through their crisis on their own, without putting others into dangers. Padded cells are made in special ways so that those having the crisis cannot hurt themselves. Padded cells have been used for a long time in psychiatry. In the 1980s, their use declied in Europe. This is because there are drugs that can be given that make them nearly unnecessary.
They are still widely used especially in Africa and Asia.
Seizures and crises are usually very tiring. For this reason, patients usually only spend a short time in these cells. They usually collapse because of fatigue rather quickly. When they do, they need medical attention quickly.

The River Yare is a river in the county of Norfolk, England.
The river starts south of Dereham in the county of Norfolk. From there it flows to the east. The river flows along the southern edge of the city of Norwich. The river continues past Norwich into the tidal lake of Breydon Water. Here the Yare is joined by the Rivers Bure and Waveney. It empties into North Sea at Gorleston, Great Yarmouth.
Small coastal boats can sail along the river from Norwich to the North Sea. In the past, the river had a large amount of boats carrying good to Norwich. Larger modern boats can not get across Breydon Water because it is not deep enough. Because of this, a canal was created at Reedham to provides a connection to the River Waveney.

In cryptography, confusion and diffusion are two properties of the operation of a secure cipher.
Diffusion is associated with the dependency of the output bits on the input bits. In a cipher with good diffusion, flipping an input bit should change each output bit with a probability of one half (this is termed the Strict Avalanche Criterion).
Substitution (a rule for replacing plaintext symbols by another) has been identified as a mechanism for primarily confusion (see S-box); on the other hand transposition using P-box) (rearranging or swapping the order of symbols) is a technique for diffusion, although other mechanisms are also used in modern practice, such as linear transformations (e.g. in AES). Product ciphers use alternating substitution and transposition phases (rounds) to achieve both confusion and diffusion respectively.

Registration is a method of officially recording something. Usually something is registered to claim more rights, or to protect ownership, or because the law says it must be registered to be used legally.
A register was a large book. It was used like a diary to record business dealings or other events.

Births, deaths, and marriages are registered to prove the date the event happened. In the United Kingdom these records are kept by the local registrar, who is in charge of the Register office.
Motor Vehicles are registered to prove who owns the vehicle. Cars or vans that not registered cannot be driven on roads. Aircraft not registered cannot be flown. Proof that a vehicle is registered is the number plate or licence plate. Vehicles must also be registered before they can be insured in case of an accident or in case of theft.
Books might be registered to show the date when copyright protection starts. Usually this is done by sending a copy of the book to a special national library.
People who stay in a hotel register their names and addresses when they arrive. The hotel can then workout how much the people most pay for their stay. The local police may also keep a copy of these names to help fight crime.

A microtiter plate (sometimes called a microplate) is a flat plate with lots of "wells" used as small test tubes.

A microtiter plate is used mostly in laboratories and pharmacies. A microtiter plate could have 6, 24, 96, 384 or even sometimes 1536 wells arranged in rows. Some microplates, used in the industry, have been built with 3456 or sometimes 9600 wells for maximum efficiancy. Each well of a microplate can only hold very small amounts of liquid.

The first microplate was made in 1951 by a Hungarian man called Dr. G. Takatsky, who made a microtiter plate with 6 rows of 12 wells (so 72 wells). Microtiter plates started being used in bulk in the late 1950's, a man called John Liner from USA had made a different, but better version. By 1990 more than 15 companies were making microtiter plates. People say that 125 million microplates were used in 2000 alone.
In 1996, the Society for Biomolecular Screening (SBS) wanted to make the microplate have standards to live up to. And so in 2003, microplates had to have a certain diameter and depth.
Instrument companies have made plate readers which can detect specific biological, chemical or physical changes in chemicals in these plates.

A myrmecophile is an animal that lives with ants. A myrmecophile may help the ants, or it may be a parasite of the ants by eating them or their food.
Many myrmecophiles eat waste in ant nests, such as dead ants or fungi growing in the nest. Some myrmecophiles make food that the ants can eat. Aphids do this when they make honeydew. Ants may even farm or tend some insects, such as aphids, that make food for them. Other myrmecophiles eat the food supplies of ants, and a few eat ant eggs, larvae, or pupae.
One family (group) of butterflies lives with ants and sometimes makes food for the ants. The ants help the butterfly caterpillars by keeping away other animals that want to eat or hurt the caterpillars.
Other animals that live with ants include some beetles, flies, mites, and spiders. Flies in the genus (group) called "Microdon" live in ant nests and eat waste or eat larval ants.

Wind speed is a term that is used when one talks about the movement of air from one place to the next.
Wind speeds usually mean the movement of air in an outside environment, but the speed of movement of air inside is important in many areas, including weather forecasting, aircraft and maritime operations, building and civil engineering. High wind speeds can cause unpleasant side effects, and strong winds often have special names, including gales, hurricanes, and typhoons.

The most elementary method of measuring wind speed is to estimate the speed from observed phenomena, this is the basis of the Beaufort Scale, for example, zero on the Beaufort Scale can be recognised by vertically rising smoke. Obviously this method is not the most accurate available so each value on the scale represents a range of values, three on the scale for example covers wind speeds between seven and ten knots.

The Etruscan civilization was a culture in ancient Italy. The Romans named them Etrusci or Tusci. The Ancient Greeks named them Tyrrhenoi or Tyrrsenoi. The Etruscans named themselves Rasenna.
The Etruscan Civilization is very old. It began in pre-history. When it was very powerful, it was in three confederacies (areas like modern states). These three confederacies were Etruria, Latinum and the Po Valley, and Campania. The Etruscans ruled Rome until 396BC.

The Etruscan language is related to the Tyrrhenian language family and is not related to other languages. Some Etruscan letters were used by the Romans in the Latin alphabet, which English uses. When the Romans conquered the Etruscans, they wrote everything in Latin. So now we do not know much about the language. Some Romans wrote about the Etruscans and their language but it is now lost.

The Etruscans mined metals like copper and iron. They became rich and powerful and travelled around the Mediterranean Sea. The Etruscan Civilisation began to lose power in the 5th century BC. The Romans began conquering parts of Etruscan land. By the beginning of the 1st century BC, the Etruscans were entirely defeated.

A diaper (or nappy) is a piece of clothing worn by whose who cannot control their urine or feces.
Diapers can be made of cloth (usually cotton) that can be washed and used again, or diapers can be disposable (put in the garbage after they are used up). Disposable diapers are usually made of plastic or man-made (artificial) fibers and contain chemicals that are super-absorbent.
Diapers that can be washed must be folded in intricate ways (like origami) before being put on. But, with the disposable you must constantly buy new ones.
Viewed as unpleasant by some, Diapers are mostly used by children from birth until the child has been potty trained. The next most used age group is the Senior Citizen age group, however there are also adult diapers for people with medical problems.
In America, they are called this, but in the United Kingdom, Australia, and several other countries it is called a nappy (short for napkin).

A furlong is a measure of distance in imperial and U.S. systems. It is equal to 660 feet or 201.168 metres. There are eight furlongs in a mile.
The English first used the furlong in the 9th century or before. The name "furlong" comes from the Old English words "furh" (furrow) and "lang" (long). Originally it was the length of the furrow in one acre of a ploughed field.
An acre is an area that is one furlong long and one chain wide. For this reason, the furlong was once also called an "acre's length". Around the year 1300, England standardised the furlong as 40 rods or 660 feet.
Distances for thoroughbred horse races in the United Kingdom, Ireland and the United States are still given in miles and furlongs. It is also used in the rail industry in the UK. Otherwise the unit is not used much.

The four-horned antelope ("Tetracerus quadricornis") is a bovine even-toed ungulate. It is also called by its Hindi name "Chousingha". It is different from other bovines because it has four horns instead of two.

Four-horned antelopes are about 0.60 meters high, and they weigh about 20 kilograms. They have a light yellowish-brown fur with a white underside. They have a black stripe down their forelegs. Males have four horns. The back horns are about 10 centimeters long, and the front horns are up to 4 centimeters long.

Four-horned antelopes live in India and Nepal. They live in forests. Four-horned Antelopes live alone. They eat grass.

Four-horned antelopes are hunted by trophy-hunters because of their four horns, but they are also hunted for their meat. Because of the hunting and also because of habitat loss, there are now less than 100 four-horned antelopes.such lozers

Barium is chemical element 56 on the periodic table. Its symbol is Ba.
Barium is part of a group of elements known as the alkali earth metals. It is reactive, and if you put pure barium metal in the air, it will react with oxygen. Barium has some interesting uses. Certain types of barium can be put in the body. We can see where the barium travels in the body and this can tell us whether there are problems, such as blockages.
Barium is a very toxic element, though, and is dangerous. There is a really small amount of barium in our food, and this does not cause problems. If we get barium from other places, though, it can cause many problems. Even 1 gram of barium can kill you. It is dangerous because it acts like other really important elements, such as calcium and magnesium. If barium replaces these elements, it screws up the body.

A doughnut (spelt donut in American English) is a sweet deep-fried piece of dough or batter.

The two most common types of doughnut are ring doughnuts, which are shaped like rings, and filled doughnuts, which are round and have jam, jelly, custard, whipped cream, or chocolate inside them. Most doughnut have an icing (also called a "frosting") made with icing sugar, water, and flavourings (such as chocolate). Some doughnut are rolled in sweet foods such as sugar or shredded coconut.

Doughnuts are often eaten in the morning, along with a cup of hot coffee. Doughnuts can be purchased from doughnut shops or from grocery stores. People also eat doughnuts as a dessert, or as a snack.

Doughnuts can cause health problems if they are eaten too often. One of these problems is that doughnuts contain a large amount of fat. Eating too much fat can lead to clogged arteries. When the arteries get clogged, blood doesn't go through them easily. Also, doughnut contain a large amount of sugar and white flour, which are converted into fat when they come inside our body.

An Echidna also called "spiny anteaters", is a monotreme that lives in Australia and in New Zealand. They form the family Tachyglossidae.
Echnidas have a long, tube-like mouth with a sticky tongue, but they are also covered in spines. They are also called spiny anteaters. Echidnas are monotremes, which means they have mammary glands, but lay eggs too.
The echidna has a unique way of protecting itself. With its long, sharp claws, they quickly dig a hole until only their spines are accessible. The predator will not be able to get to it without injuring itself. Spiny anteaters eat ants. They also eat other small insects. Echidnas pick up the bugs with their sticky tongues.

A wetsuit is a garment used by scuba divers, snorkelers, windsurfers, and surfers to keep themselves warm when they are in cold ocean water. Wetsuits act as insulation, and help the body to retain its heat. Wetsuits are made of plastic or rubber materials such as neoprene. Wetsuits include torso coverings, leggings, head coverings, and hand and feet coverings.

When people are doing diving or water sports in areas where the water is not very cold, they may only wear some parts of a wetsuit, such as a torso covering or leggings.
wet suits are garments that oceangoers wear!
it's very vital when going to th ocean and dive because it serves as a life and system protector.

Reward and punishment is the idea that people perform better when offered rewards, or when threatened with punishment. Both ideas are now generally believed wrong in psychology although they persist in many kinds of politics, especially those based on hate, specifically "punishing bad people" to create fear of being considered such a bad person.
Regression towards the mean is one explanation of why people believe "punishment works" when it provably does not: after a good performance, the next performance is most likely to be worse. A reward is not likely to make someone able to perform much better than their current best, so, rewards appear not to work. However, after a bad performance, the next performance is most likely to be better. Thus punishment will be perceived to work, even if the better performance has nothing to do with it and it is simply a "more average" performance.
People who do not understand, or claim not to understand, this, are common in political life, but they have no credibility at this point, and stems from a pain and pleasure view of self.

Veganism is a philosophy that says people should not use animals in any way.
Veganism is a lifestyle. Vegans choose not to eat food that comes from animals, including meat, eggs and dairy products (like milk, cheese, and yogurt). A vegan diet is sometimes called a strict vegetarian diet. Vegans also do not eat honey. Vegans try not to use any other animal products, such as leather, wool, feathers, bone, or pearl. They also try to avoid products that have been tested on animals. Some vegans campaign for animal rights.
Vegans do eat all kinds of fruits, vegetables, beans, grains, nuts, and seeds, and things made from them like vegan sweets, vegan cheese and vegan cakes.
Some people become vegan because they find about the bad treatment of animals in the modern animal farm industry. Other reasons to become vegan are health, to protect the environment, for religious reasons, or because of world hunger. Animals use most of the food they eat for their own life, not to 'grow' meat, milk or eggs. So a lot of food, land and water is wasted by keeping animals for food.

An exoskeleton supports and protects an animal's body from outside and not like the internal endoskeleton of - for example human beings - from inside.
Many invertebrate animals (such as shelled mollusks) have exoskeletons in the sense of external hard parts. But if one speaks of an exoskeleton one mostly means that of arthropods (i.e. insects, spiders, myriapods and crustaceans).
Exoskeletons contain rigid and resistant components that fulfil a set of functional roles including protection, excretion, sensing, support, feeding and (for terrestrial organisms) acting as a barrier against dessiccation. Exoskeletons first appeared in the fossil record about 550 million years ago, and their evolution has been seen as critical as a driving role in the Cambrian explosion of animals that took place subsequent to this time.

They are usually built in regular doors, but can also be in windows or walls. They usually have the hinge on the top, with no latch, so the animal can push their way in and out. Newer models sometimes only let the pet go outside, but not inside. Others have a latch and something that can be put on the pet that makes the latch open when the pet gets close to the door. They are most commonly used for pet cats, but can also be used for dogs, miniature pigs, or other small pets.

A kettle is a type of pot that is used in a kitchen. It is used to make water hot or to boil water.
In the past, kettles were made of metal like copper. Kettles were put on a rack or a hook above the fire to become hot. Now, metal kettles is put on the stove or rangetop. Sometimes they are made of ceramic or clay.
Now, some people have electric kettles. These kettles plug into the wall and use electricity to generate heat. They are usually plastic or metal. They heat water faster than kettles on a stove. Kettles are often used to make tea.
They are more common in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth than other places like the United States.

Luke the Evangelist is said to be the man who wrote the Gospel of Luke and Acts of the Apostles in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. Irenaeus, Eusebius of Caesarea and Jerome say that he was a friend of Saint Paul and a doctor, and that he accompanied Paul on some of his travels. These people also say that he was of Greek origin, from Antioch in Syria.
Modern-day scholars think that the person that wrote the two books was not the same that accompanied Paul. Paul had a theology that was special, and slightly different from that of other writers of the New Testament. The two books written by Luke never refer to this theology. Also, the name of Paul's companion is never linked to writing the two books. The Acts of the Apostles often tell things about Paul which Paul odes not tell himself in his letters.
Luke wrote about the Three Wise Men who visited Jesus in the Bible.

Thrust is a reaction force that is described by Newton's Newton's laws of motion. When a system expels or accelerates mass in one direction the accelerated mass will cause a proportional but opposite force on that system.

A fixed-wing aircraft generates forward thrust when a spinning propeller moves air, or gases are ejected from a jet engine (or rocket engine), opposite the direction of flight. The forward thrust is proportional to the (mass of the air) multiplied by (average velocity of the airstream).

Distillation is a chemical engineering unit operation where two liquids are separated from each other. You do this by simply heating the liquids until they boil. The liquids will have different vapour pressures, and so one of them will evaporate before the other does. The vapour is then led into a condenser, which takes off its heat and condenses it back to liquid. A fractionating column can be used to improve the separation. Distillation is a mass transfer unit operation.
The vapourized and condensed component is called "distillate" and the other component as "bottom product"
This has been used for a long time, to distill alcohol, and produced distilled beverages. Distillation is a commonly used operation in oil industry, where it is used to produce various fuels and raw materials from crude oil.
Illegally distilled alcoholic drink is called "moonshine".

The Bronze Medal of Military Valor (Italian language: "Medaglia di bronzo al Valore Militare") is an Italian medal awarded by the King of Italy.
During World War I, the medal was awarded to military personnel for exceptional valor in combat. For each subsequent act of valor, the recipient was awarded a bar in the corresponding class. As the Gold medal and the Silver Medal, after the World War II, the Bronze Medal was gave to the cities that fought against the nazism and the fascism during the war.

The Hajj is the pilgrimage to Mecca, where the Kaaba is located.The Kaaba is a large, black cube situated in "The great mosque" in Mecca.
The pilgrimage is one of the five most important duties a Muslim must do. These duties are called the Five Pillars of Islam.
Muslims must make the Hajj at least once in a lifetime if they can afford it. Usually pilgrims go on a seven day roundtrip around the religious sites. The Kaaba is a holy place for Muslims and shows Muslims that each and every Muslim is equal in the eyes of God, and that he or she must be willing to give up anything are do anything for him. When on the pilgrimage special plain clothes should be worn.
The Hajj differs from an ordinary pilgrimage, Umrah, as it can only happen at a certain time of the year. The right time of the year is from the 8th to 12th day of Dhu al-Hijjah, the 12th month of the Islamic calendar. Because the Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar, eleven days shorter than the Gregorian calendar used in the Western world, the Gregorian date of the Hajj is eleven days earlier from year to year.
An ordinary or lesser pilgrimage, Umrah, can be performed at any time of the year. The rituals of Umrah are also performed for Hajj, but there are actions that are exclusive to Hajj.
The pilgrimage to Mecca is very popular as millions of Muslims visit the Islamic city each year!

Time travel is a fictional (made up) activity of going back in time to the past of the future. Scientists such as physicists say that time travel is not possible with our current technologies.

Science fiction and fantasy movies and TV shows have been based on stories of people who travel through time. For example the US movie "Back to the Future" tells a made-up story about a professor who builds a machine that can take people into the future or back in the past.
Another example of a made-up story about time travel is in "Charmed", but instead of using machines and science, they use magic to go to specific times and places.

Saxe-Gotha () was a state in today's Thuringia, Germany.
It was created in 1640 for Duke Ernest I and ended in 1680 when his lands were divided after his death in 1675. The area around Gotha passed to Ernest's eldest surviving son, Frederick of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, who also inherited Altenburg (which Ernest had inherited through his wife Elisabeth Sophie) and became Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg.

When the house of Saxe-Gotha and Altenburg became extinct in 1825, Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg was split. Saxe-Gotha passed to the Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld who in turn gave Saalfeld to Saxe-Meiningen. The Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen became Duke of Saxe-Altenburg, and gave Saxe-Hildburghausen to Saxe-Meiningen.
After the abolition of German monarchies at the end of the First World War it became a part of the newly created state of Thuringia in 1920.

A cupcake (or fairy cake) is a small cake made to serve one person, usually made in a small paper cup container. As with larger cakes, icing and other decorations, such as sprinkles, are often put on them.
Similar to American-style muffins, cupcakes are often served during a celebration, such as children's classroom birthday parties. They are a convenient alternative to cake because they do not require plates, utensils, or dividing into pieces because they are small. Cupcakes were first invented in the early 1800's.
A simple cupcake uses the same ingredients as most other standard cakes - using butter, sugar, eggs, and flour.

Windows 3.1x was a family of Microsoft Windows operating systems released from 1992 to 1994. The previous version of Windows before this one was Windows 3.0. This Windows could run in either Standard or 386 Enhanced memory modes. Both of the modes used a Graphical User Interface (or picture-based), and supported a mouse, but 386 Enhanced Mode was faster and was better at multitasking (or doing for things at once).
Windows 3.1x also had many features from versions of Windows before it. These inculded a calcuator, a notepad, and more. It also brought in many new features, like the Program Manager (which is still in Windows XP today - Start>Run>progman.exe), and the icons and programs looked better.
Windows 3.1x was made better in 1994, with Windows for Workgroups, that added networking support.
It was the last Windows version to feature the program manager.

"Half-Life" is a science fiction first-person shooter computer game developed by Valve Software and published by Sierra Entertainment in 1998, based on a very changed "Quake" game engine. It was first published for PCs running Microsoft Windows, and was later ported to Sony's PlayStation 2 video game console.
"Half-Life", often shortened to "HL", has been thought to be very great by computer game critics for its gripping in-depth storyline, which would influence the development of other first-person shooters in the years to come.
"Half-Life" was followed by a sequel, Half-Life 2 in 2004.
Half-Life 2 was then followed by two other games, and.

In mathematics, a power series (in one variable) is an infinite series of the form
where "an" represents the coefficient of the nth term, "c" is a constant, and "x" varies around "c" (for this reason one sometimes speaks of the series as being "centered" at "c"). This series usually arises as the Taylor series of some known function; the Taylor series article contains many examples.
In many situations "c" is equal to zero, for instance when considering a Maclaurin series.
In such cases, the power series takes the simpler form
These power series arise primarily in analysis, but also occur in combinatorics (under the name of generating functions) and in electrical engineering (under the name of the Z-transform). The familiar decimal notation for integers can also be viewed as an example of a power series, but with the argument "x" fixed at 10. In number theory, the concept of p-adic numbers is also closely related to that of a power series.

The English free settlers were the people that chose to go to Australia. They were not forced to go there like the convicts were. The English free settlers went to Australia between the late 17th century and the early 18th century. This was after the convicts were sent to Australia. When the English free settlers got to Australia, they landed in the southern part of the continent. That was the only colony created by the free settlers.
The English free settlers went to Australia to be free. They wanted to make money as well. They also wanted to explore Australia. Most of them were families who wanted a better life with their children. Some people called the English Free settlers "Pilgrims".

Tools are objects used to help make tasks easier to do. Tools have evolved over time, and innovations in tools came during periods such as the Stone Age and Bronze Age. More useful materials were used and better tools were created. These creations and inventions became modern tools.
Some examples of tools that are often used today are the hammer, the wrench (also called a spanner), saws, and shovel. Very basic things like knives and pens and pencils are tools. The bludgeon (a stick or rock used to smash things) was the very first tool made by humans. The knife is also one of the first tools humans ever made.

Simultaneous multithreading, acronym SMT, is a technique for improving the overall efficiency of superscalar CPUs with Hardware multithreading. SMT permits multiple independent threads of execution to better utilize the resources provided by modern computer architectures.
Multithreading is similar in concept to multitasking but is implemented at the thread level of execution in modern superscalar processors.
The key factor to distinguish them is to look at how many instructions the processor can issue in one cycle and how many threads from which the instructions come.

The name Cryolophosaurus means "frozen crested reptile." The characteristic feature of this dinosaur is the large crest on the top of the skull, above the eyes. The nasal bones extend toward the back of the skull as ridges, and then join with the lacrimal bones to form a grooved crest which extends perpendicularly from the skull. Cryolophosaurus was discovered in the Jurassic Hanson Formation in the Transantarctic Mountains and represents the only theropod dinosaur to be found in Antarctica.
The dinosaur was discovered by Dr. William Hammer during a 1990-91 expedition. Dr. Hammer is a professor of geology at Augustana College in Rock Island, IL, where a cast of Cryolophosaurus currently resides. The find of this dinosaur was significant because it proves that the dinosaurs lived on all of the continents and that high latitude climates were tolerated by dinosaurs. Cryolophosaurus is also of significance because it represents the oldest known tetanuran from any continent- it is the only one from the Early Jurassic.

Ergastic substances are non-protoplasm materials that one can find in cells. The living protoplasm of a cell is sometimes called the "bioplasm" and something else than the ergastic substances of the cell.
These are usually organic or inorganic substances that are products of metabolism, and include crystals, oil drops, gums, tannins, resins and other compounds that can help the organism in defense, maintenance of cellular structure, or just substance storage. During the lifetime of a cell, these can appear and disappear. They indicate some level of participation in life processes. Ergastic substances may appear in the protoplasm, in vacuoles, or in the cell wall.

The Carbon Cycle is a biogeochemical process where carbon is recycled through the ecosystem. The concentration of carbon in living matter (18%) is almost 100 times greater than its concentration in the earth (0.19%). So living things extract carbon from their nonliving environment. For life to continue, this carbon must be recycled. See the diagram for a detailed look at the carbon cycle. An example of a route carbon takes in this cycle is carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by plants and used in photosynthesis to produce sugars which the plant uses for energy. When the plant dies, it decomposes and the carbon stored in the plant will, over millions of years, form into coal (a fossil fuel). The coal is burnt and gives off carbon dioxide which goes into the atmosphere.
At the moment, the carbon cycle, and how human activity is affecting it, is a big topic in international news. Fossil fuels are a non-renewable resource which means that once we've burned them all, there isn't any more, and our use of fossil fuels has nearly doubled every 20 years since 1900. Also, the burning of fossil fuels produces pollution which contributes to the greenhouse effect and acid rain.

Flint, or flintstone, is a kind of igneous rock, which means that it came from volcanic action inside the Earth. Flintstones often have a rough lumpy surface but when they are broken, they look like dull grease-coloured glass. It has been one of the most useful types of stone to humankind.
Flintstones were often used in prehistoric times to make stone tools. When flintstones are broken, they have a sharp edge which could be used as a knife, or a scraper.
When two flintstones are hit together, they can make a spark. For many centuries, flint was one of the main ways for people in many countries to make fire. People would carry a little box called a "tinder box" which had some flintstones and tinder. The tinder was used to catch the spark and start a fire. Tinder could be sawdust, cloth, grass or bark. Flints were used to make a spark to fire a gun. A gun that used flint was called a "flint-lock" gun.
Flintstones are used in some countries for building. In England the flintstones used for building were often "knapped" which means they were broken to show the inside. This made a nicer finish on the building that the dull knobbly stones.

San Gimignano is a small hill town in the province of Siena, Tuscany, Italy. San Gimignano is famous for the medieval towers, and for the wine, called "Vernaccia di San Gimignano".

San Gimignano was founded as a small village in about 1300 BC by the Etruscans. The name of the city come from by a saint, Saint Geminianus, who had defended it from Attila's Huns.
In medieval and Renaissance times, it was a stopping point for pilgrims on their way to Rome and the Vatican as it sits on the medieval via Francigena.
In 1199, during the period of its highest splendour, the city made itself independent from Volterra.

There are many churches in the town: the two main ones are the "Collegiata", a cathedral, and "Sant'Agostino".
The Communal Palace is now the home of San Gimignano Gallery. Hhere there are works by Pinturicchio, Benozzo Gozzoli, Filippino Lippi, Domenico di Michelino, Pier Francesco Fiorentino, and others.
The heart of the town contains the four squares, "Piazza della Cisterna", "Piazza Duomo", "Piazza Pecori", and "Piazza delle Erbe".

San Gimignano is the birthplace of the poet Folgore da San Gimignano (1270-1332).
"Tea with Mussolini", a 1999 drama about English and American women in Italy during World War II, was filmed in part at San Gimignano.

Xylem is the water transporter cells of plants. It carries water around a plant.

Xylem vessels are a long straight chain made of long dead cells known as vessel elements. The cells are arranged end to end and the cell walls which would normally surround the whole cell dissolve where ever they are touching another cell wall. This makes a tube (because there is no blocking cell wall) sometimes the cells are just filled with holes rather than have no blocking cell-wall.
The secondary walls of vessels are filled with lignin, a kind of glue. The thickness of a xylem vessel will vary, with a different thickness, the water can be carried along a tube more easily.

Xylem vessels work because of th transpiration stream. It is caused by the evaporation of water from the cells in the leaf to the atmosphere. This transpiration causes millions of tiny rings of cartilage to form in the cell wall of the leaf. The resulting surface tension causes pressure in the xylem that pulls the water from the roots and soil.

Conduction in science is when energy moves from one places to another place. Heat and electricity are two kinds of energy that move by conduction. Something that energy can easily move through is a good conductor. Metal is a good conductor. An insulator is a bad conductor. Energy can not move quickly through an insulator. Plastics are one kind of insulator.

Baldur (Baldr, Balder) is Odin's second son. He is the god of summer sun, light, and radiance. His twin brother is the blind god of darkness, Hodhr. His wife is called Nanna. They have a son, called Forseti, god of justice. Baldur also has a ship, which is the largest ship ever built. It is called Hringhorni. His hall is called Breidlabik.
Based on the Merseburg charms, his germanic name may have been Phol.
Baldur once had a bad dream that he would be killed. His mother, Frigg, made all the things on Earth vow not to hurt him. But she forgot the mistletoes. Loki made a spear out of mistletoes, and tricked Hodhr to kill Baldur with it. The death of Baldur is the start of Ragnarok. Many gods and goddesses came to his funeral. His wife Nana also died of sadness. His father, Odin, placed the golden ring Draupnir on Baldur, but he later sent the ring back from Hell. This ring somehow came to Freyr's hand.
After Ragnarok and the death of Odin, Baldur and Hodhr came back to heaven, and they rule in place of their father.

The ethmoid bone (from Greek "ethmos", "sieve") is a bone in the skull that separates the nasal cavity from the brain. As such, it is located at the roof of the nose, between the two orbits. The cubical bone is lightweight due to a spongy construction.

Blows to the head can shear off the olfactory nerves that pass though the ethmoid bone and cause anosmia, an irreversible loss of the sense of smell and a great reduction in the sense of taste (most of which depends on smell). This not only deprives life of some of its pleasures, but can also be dangerous, as when a person fails to smell smoke, gas, or spoiled food.

The National League (or NL) is one of the two leagues that make up Major League Baseball. The "National League" is made up of 16 teams. At the end of each season, four of these teams go to the "post-season" where one will win the National League championship. The champions of the National League plays against the champions of the American League in the World Series. The team that wins the World Series is the champion of Major League Baseball.

The only big differences between the National League and the American League is the number of teams (the American League has 14 teams) and that the American League uses the "Designated Hitter" (or DH). The Designated Hitter is a player who does not play in the field, but is used to bat for the worst hitter in his team's "lineup", usually the pitcher. The National League does not use the Designated Hitter, and all players in the side must bat and field for themselves.

The ELISA method (Enzyme Linked Immuno-Sorbent Assay) is a technique used in biochemistry to determine if a certain substance--such as a specific cytokine or antigen--is present within a sample. It is sometimes abbreviated as "EIA."
This technique uses special antibodies that attach themselves to the substance. These antibodies generate a specific color. The amount of color indicates the amount of substance present. (Sometimes, the substance must be viewed under ultraviolet light for the antibodies to generate this color.)
Another set of antibodies are used to "capture" the substance. These antibodies adhere to both the substance and the testing container, thus holding the substance in place.
A more sophisticated and sensitive technique, the ELISPOT method, was derived from the ELISA techique.

In physics, buoyancy is the upward force on an object produced by the surrounding fluid (i.e., a liquid or a gas) in which it is fully or partially immersed, due to the pressure difference of the fluid between the top and bottom of the object.
The net upward buoyancy force is equal to the magnitude of the weight of fluid that is displaced by the body. This force enables the object to float or at least to seem lighter. Buoyancy is important for many vehicles such as boats, ships, balloons, and Blimps.

If the object has exactly the same density as the liquid, then its buoyancy equals its weight. It will tend neither to sink nor float.
An object with a higher average density than the fluid has less buoyancy than weight and it will sink.
A ship floats because although it is made of steel which is more dense than water, it encloses a volume of air and the resulting shape has an average density less than that of the water.

The Peripheral nervous system, or PNS, is part of the nervous system, and consists of the nerves and neurons that are outside the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) and serve the limbs and organs, for example.
The PNS is not protected by bone like the central nervous system. Therefore it is exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries. The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system (SNS) and the autonomic nervous system (ANS). But the enteric nervous system (ENS) can be seen as a third branch of its own and not as part of the autonomic nervous system.

In Computing, a home directory is a special directory (or location in the File system, Apple calls directories "folders"). Very often, there is one such home directory per user. Some users, which were created by the system and usually do not log in, do not have such a home directory.
A home directory is used to store personal files of the respective user, including written document and settings for programs.
Unix, Linux and the like.
On Unix and Linux-like operating systems, the directory is usually called like the username. It is usually located in the "/home" hierarchy. A user "fred" would therefore his home directory in "/home/fred".
It can be written as "~".

Since Windows 95 there is a directory called "My Documents". It was introduced together with "My Computer". It helps the users locate their files. Since Windows 2000 it is located in the user's profile directory "Documents and Settings\username". So a user "fred" will find his files in "Documents and Settings\fred\My Documents". In Windows Vista the directory has lost the "My", and is simply called "Documents". Other directories, which are similar, may exist. They are called "My Music", "My pictures" and "My videos".

The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is the most powerful part of the United Nations. The Security Council deals with maintaining peace and security between nations.

The ten temporary seats are held for two years with member states (countries) voted in by the UN General Assembly on a regional basis. The Presidency of the Security Council (ie the leadership) is rotated alphabetically each month.

If a country has behaved in a way seen as undesirable, the UNSC can make a ruling, known as United Nations Security Council Resolutions or sanctions. An example is that the UNSC has currently banned all imports of nuclear material to Iran as they feel Iran is going to make nuclear weapons.

A Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough (TUTT) is a trough situated in upper-level (at about 200 hPa) tropics. Its formation is usually caused by the expansion of the Trough of Westerlies Wind to the tropics. It can also develop from the inverted trough adjacent to a upper level anticyclone. TUTTs are different from mid-latitude troughs in the sense that they are maintained by subsidence warming near the tropopause which balances radiation cooling.
TUTTs sometimes brings a large amount of vertical wind shear over tropical disturbances and cyclones and thus hinder their development. On the contrary, there are cases that TUTTs assist the genesis and intensification of tropical cyclones by providing additional forced ascent near the storm center and an efficient outflow channel in the upper troposphere. Moreover, under specific circumstances, TUTTs can grow into upper cold lows and may enhance the development of low level disturbances.

Naming very small numbers is the same as naming very big numbers, but with one important difference. There is a minus sign over what the 10 in the formula is raised to. So if one wanted to write 0.007 in shorthand form, they would write it 7 x 10-3 since 7 is the third digit after the decimal point (the zero in front of the decimal point doesn't count). Naming a very small number with lots of different numbers inside it is the same as doing it with a very big number, but again with that one difference of the minus sign. So 0.0000452 would become 4.52 x 10-5 (0.0000452 --> 4.52 x 0.00001 --> 4.52 x 10-5).

Snowballs is a ball of snow. They are usually made by a person picking snow up in their hands and pressing it together in the ball the size of their hand. Snowballs are usually thrown at people or objects as a game called a snowball fight. Making snowballs is a common activity for children when it snows.
Larger snowballs are made by using a ball the size of a hand and rolling it on the ground. As more snow sticks to it, the ball grows larger. Larger snowballs are often used to make Snowmen. The term "Snowball effect" comes from this. It means as things go on, they get larger in the same way that a snowball gets larger are it rolls.

In chemistry, a solution is a homogeneous mixture of one or more substances. The substances that are dissolved are named solutes. The substance the solutes are dissolved in is named a solvent. An example from everyday experience is a solid (like salt or sugar) dissolved in a liquid (like water). Gases can dissolve in liquids. An example is carbon dioxide or oxygen in water. Liquids may dissolve in other liquids and gases in other gases.
Examples of solid solutions are alloys and some minerals.

The Animals were an English music group, who were most popular in the 1960s. They were known for their bluesy sound, and their deep-voiced singer Eric Burdon.
One of their first hit songs, "The House Of The Rising Sun", was an old American folk song, which they performed with a rock and roll beat. Folk musician Bob Dylan was impressed by the Animals version of the song.
Other Animals hits included "We Gotta Get Out Of This Place", "Don't Bring Me Down", "It's My Life", "See See Rider", "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood", and "Sky Pilot". The original Animals disbanded, and Burdon moved to the United States, where he formed a new version of the band. They made more records, like "San Franciscan Nights".
The original Animals reunited in later years, to perform concerts, and Burdon performed Animals songs with other bands. Bass guitarist Chas Chandler became a music producer, with artists like Jimi Hendrix.

Sedimentary rocks are rocks that are made from sediments (pieces of other rocks, animals, plants or minerals). Sedimentary rocks cover 75-80% of the Earth's land area. Other types of rock are igneous rock and metamorphic rock).

Chalk, limestone, and dolomite, are all made from a mixture of minerals and pieces of animals (especially animal shells). They are mostly formed in oceans.
Shale, sandstone, and conglomerate are all Clastic rocks (They are made from pieces of other rocks) The pieces may have come from erosion by water, ice or wind.
Coal is made from ancient plants.These rocks can be found any where in the universe.
The sediments become rock either by being buried and squeezed together or by being stuck together by a solution washing through them. When sedimentary rocks are heated, they become metamorphic rocks. They come from igneous rocks. The rocks all go round in a cycle.

Salamanders are amphibians. They are the order "Caudata" (also called "Urodela").
Salamanders live in water and on land. Salamanders look like lizards, with four legs and a tail. They hatch from eggs in the water. When they are babies (called larvae), they live like fish and have gills that stick out.
Most salamanders live on land when they are adults, after changing their shape. This change is called metamorphosis. They lose their gills and fins and start to breathe air. They also drink water through their skin. Some salamanders stay in the water, but look like adults. These are called newts. These kinds of salamanders have poison. Some salamanders look like babies their whole lives. This is called neoteny.
People used to think salamanders lived in fire, but this was a myth.
There are about 500 different species of salamanders;

A radio telescope is like a huge satellite dish. An ordinary telescope allows people to see light from distant objects. Stars shine and the light can be seen with a telescope, but they also give off radio waves. Scientists with radio telescopes receive these radio waves and use computers to learn about the stars. Other things like black holes also give off radio waves and radio telescopes are useful for learning about them too.
The dish is sometimes constructed of a conductive wire mesh whose openings are smaller than a wavelength. The information received by several radio telescopes in different places can be combined. This gives similar results to having a single dish as big as the distance between the telescopes, so even very faint signals can be received. Scientists are also trying to do this with ordinary telescopes.
The radio telescope at the Parkes Observatory, Parkes, New South Wales was used by NASA to receive messages from the Apollo 11 moon landings.

A snack is a kind of food. It is usually small in size, and can be any kind of food that you do not eat in large amount. Because it is not meant to be a meal, a snack is not breakfast, lunch or dinner. People eat snacks if they are hungry between meals. For example, eating potato chips after lunch but before dinner is eating a snack. Snacks are easy to eat and portable, in most cases. Examples of snacks are: Mars, Snickers, Bounty and Twix. These are made of chocolate and with a different filling. If you eat a snack it will give you energy which usually comes from the large amounts of sugar and/or fat in the food, so eating snacks is good for you, most of the time. We need the energy from the food because we loose energy:walking, enduring in sport and even concentrating.

A polygon is a closed two-dimensional shape. It usually has three sides/corners or more. It has a number of edges. These edges are connected by lines. A square is a polygon because it has four sides. The smallest possible polygon in a Euclidean geometry or "flat geometry" is the triangle, but on a sphere, there can be a digon. The monogon is a theoretical figure that cannot exist - it has only one side and one edge.
If the edges (lines of the polygon) do not intersect (cross each other), the polygon is called "simple", otherwise it is "complex".
In computer graphics, polygons (especially triangles) are often used to make graphics.

In "Dollhouse", Dushku plays a young woman named Echo. She is one of a group of men and women who can have "personality packages" put into their minds. These packages can include many things, for example, memory, skills, language and muscle memory. These people live in a futuristic dormitory/laboratory named the "Dollhouse". They are given special personas as part of the personality packages. These are used to do many different types of assignments. For example, the jobs could be romantic, adventurous, strange, or illegal. After the assignment, the information is removed from their minds and they are left in a child-like state with no memories. The series follows Echo as she begins to remember things even though her mind is constantly being erased and new memories implanted into it.

The Intolerable Acts or the Coercive Acts were names given by the American colonists to a number of laws passed by the British Parliament in 1774.
The British Parliament passed these laws to punish the Massachusetts colony for the Boston Tea Party. One of the laws closed Boston Harbor until the colonists paid for the destroyed tea. Another law banned the committees of correspondence. Still another law allowed Britain to house troops where ever it wanted to. The Laws were so harsh that the colonist called them the Intolerable Acts.
Other colonies offered Massachusetts their support. They sent supplies to Boston. The committees of correspondence also called for a meeting of all colonies. This meeting would decide what to do about the problems with Britain.

New Year's Eve
New Year's Eve is the holiday before New Year's Day, on December 31, the last day of the current year.
In modern times, Western countries usually celebrate this day with a party which culminates with a group countdown to the midnight hour. Party hats, noisemakers, fire crackers and drinking champagne are fairly common during this holiday.
Many municipalities also offer fireworks displays and other noisy ways to usher in the new year, at midnight. Places like Berlin, Chicago, Edinburgh, Los Angeles, London, New York, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Sydney, Toronto, and Tokyo are well known for their New Year's Eve celebrations.
New Year's Eve is also a work holiday in some countries, such as Australia, Argentina, Brazil, France, Mexico, the Philippines, and Venezuela.

A word processor is a computer program (often a text editor) or a special computer intended to edit texts with colors and different font sizes and styles, or texts which will be printed.
Most such programs now have helpful instruments (tools) to make good texts. Some of the important instruments have a spelling & grammar checker, word count (this also counts letters and lines). Moreover, with such programs one can make attractive documents, add pictures into documents, make web pages, graphs etc. Also, they show synonyms (similar words) of words and some can read out the text. Many word processors, similar to many new programs, have configurable printing facilities.
Most people use Microsoft Word, which they buy in a shop or download illegally.
Some people use OpenOffice.org Writer, which they download legally with OpenOffice.org; or KWord for KDE.
There are also many other programs like that.

Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is a suite of protocols for securing Internet Protocol (IP) communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet of a data stream. IPsec also includes protocols for establishing mutual authentication between agents at the beginning of the session and negotiation of cryptographic keys to be used during the session. IPsec can be used to protect data flows between a pair of hosts (e.g. computer users or servers), between a pair of security gateways (e.g. routers or firewalls), or between a security gateway and a host. RFC 2406
IPsec is an end-to-end security solution and operates at the Internet Layer of the Internet Protocol Suite, comparable to Layer 3 in the OSI model. Other Internet security protocols in widespread use, such as SSL, TLS and SSH, operate in the upper layers of these models. This makes IPsec more flexible, as it can be used for protecting all the higher level protocols, because applications don't need to be designed to use IPsec, whereas the use of TLS/SSL or other higher-layer protocols must be built-in the application.
The term "IPsec" is officially defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). This definition includes the form of capitalization used for the term; it is often incorrectly spelled "IPSec".

Philosophy of language is the study of how languages were created and are used. It is part of Linguistics. In continental philosophy, it is not treated as a subject by itself, but Ludwig Wittgenstein and other analytic philosophers placed particular stress on it.

Plato was the first philosopher we know was interested in philosophy of language (although his teacher Socrates probably was too).He believed that the smallest parts of words (Phonemes) had meaning even if they were outside the words they are in. This is not a very good theory, and Plato understood that there were things wrong with it.The Stoics also made a complicated philosophy of language.

The medieval scholars, such as William Occam also were interested in philosophy of language. Occam was the first philosopher to think about the possibility of a mental language. He also discussed how a word can refer to both its meaning and the actual word itself.

Philosophy of language only became more popular in the twentieth century, when Ferdinand de Saussure wrote his book Course in general linguistics. Since then, philosophy of language has played an important part in philosophy as a whole.

A LASER (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) is a machine that makes a very intense beam of light. It works by light being made brighter by lots of its energy being reflected many times. The first working laser was displayed on May 16, 1960 by Theodore Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories.. Since then, it has many commercial and industrial uses, like in factories and computers. It is also used a lot in science fiction writing and films.
One use of lasers is in optical disc drives used in computers, compact disc and DVD players, in which the laser (a few millimeters in size) looks at the surface of the disc. Other uses of lasers are in bar code readers, laser printers and laser pointers.

A laser light is made up of a single wave length with all the waves lined up. Laser light stays in a straight, concentrated beam. Lasers also produce frequencies beyond the visible light range, so a laser beam is not always seen by the eye.

The Post Office Department is the former name of the United States Postal Service when it was a Cabinet department. It was headed by the United States Postmaster General.
The Postal Service Act signed by President George Washington on February 20, 1792 established the Department. Postmaster General John McLean was the first to call it the Post Office "Department" rather than just the "Post Office." The organization received a boost in prestige when President Andrew Jackson invited his Postmaster General, William T. Barry, to sit as a member of the Cabinet.
During the Civil War, postal services in the Confederacy were provided by the Confederate States of America Post Office Department, headed by Postmaster General John Henninger Reagan.
The Postal Reorganization Act signed by President Richard Nixon on August 12, 1970, replaced the cabinet-level Post Office Department with the independent United States Postal Service. The Act took effect on July 1, 1971.

The Tyrannosaurus was a big predator from the Cretaceous time. The Tyrannosaurus was about 12 meters long and had a weight of about six tons. The teeth of the Tyrannosaurus were about 16 cm long.
The Tyrannosaurus ate meat. Some scientists argue about whether or not it was a hunter or a scavenger, but like most dominant meat-eaters of today, such as lions or hyenas, Tyrannosaurus might have done both. It had a very strong jaw, and its bite power could snap the bones of other dinosaurs. For a long time, Tyrannosaurus was said to be the biggest meat-eating dinosaur, but new dinosaurs have been found that might outsize it. Skeletons of the Tyrannosaurus were found on the North American continent, but relatives of Tyrannosaurus, like Tarbosaurus, have been found in Asia.
The earliest Tyrannosaurus skeletons were found in 1892. Henry Fairfield Osborn, president of the American Museum of Natural History, named the species "Tyrannosaurus Rex" (meaning "tyrant lizard king") in 1905. The most complete skeleton was found in 1990 in South Dakota.
Tyrannosaurus has become very popular. Many movies and television shows have featured Tyrannosaurus, such as Jurassic Park. The skeletons of Tyrannosaurus are popular exhibits in museums. Another name for Tyrannosaurus Rex is "T-Rex". It was harmful to many dinosaurs.

The vascular cambium is a lateral meristem.
It is the source of both the secondary xylem (inwards, towards the pith) and the secondary phloem (outwards), and is between these tissues in the stem and root. Only a few leaves even have a vascular cambium.
Vascular cambium is a type of meristem - a tissue consisting of embryonic (not specialized) cells which can produce other (and more differentiated) plant tissues originate. Primary meristems are the apical meristems on root tips and shoot tips. Another lateral meristem is the cork cambium, which produces cork, part of the bark.

Whyalla is a city located on Eyre Peninsula, on the shore of Spencers Gulf, South Australia.

Its main industries are associated with the iron ore mines founded by BHP several KM inland.

Originally it acted as the port for the export of Iron Ore, then in order to obtain the renewal of the mining lease, BHP was forced by the then government of South Australia to build a blast furnace to smelt the ore into pig iron. This eventually led to the establishment of steel making, and ship building industries, which were very active during the period 1960 - 1980.

The viability of these industries so far from markets had progressively declined, culminating in closure of many operations and a decline in the local population. At its peak, during the mid 1980's the population was about 35,000 people.

A rainforest (or "rain forest") is a tropical forest that gets a lot of rain. It usually has a lot of plants and animals. A very well known rainforest is the Amazon Rainforest. Most of it is in Brazil, though Ecuador, Colombia, Chile and other countries have parts of it.
Scientists say over half of all plant and animal species live in the rainforest. Also more than 1/4 of all medicines come from here. Covering only 2% of the Earth's land area they still provide 40% of the oxygen.
The rainforest can be found in three major geographical areas around the world.
The rainforest gets an average of 50 to 250 inches of rain a year. It is warm year round rarely getting above 93 F or getting below 68 F. It has an average humidity of 77 to 88%
The rainforest has carpet of green rot leaves on the floor. This is called the humus layer.

An air gun is a gun which uses gas to fire a projectile instead of burning gunpowder that an ordinary gun uses.
The oldest air guns used a spring to compress (squeeze) air in a tube. When the gun was fired the air was released. The only way for the air to go was by pushing the pellet out. A spring loaded gun can only fire one shot before the spring has to be reset. Newer guns use air or another gas in a small cartridge, these guns can fire many more shots before the cartridge needs to be changed or refilled.
The projectile for an air gun is usually a pellet. Some guns of this sort fire small round pellets call "bb"s. Some people think this means ball bearing, but it does not. The letters bb stood for a size of shot that was used to make shotgun cartridges, This was used in the first bb guns.
The most popular calibres (pellet sizes) for air weapons are mm (also called.177 to.22). In many countries there are strict rules that limit the sales of air guns so not everyone can have one.
They are not as powerful as other guns but they can still kill people.
Many people enjoy air rifle and pistol shooting either for fun or hunting. In the Olympics and Commonwealth Games air pistols are used in some of the shooting events.

Hungarian Vizlas are a type of dog, known for being affectionate and not aggressive. They originated in Hungary and are excellent hunting dogs.

The breed was developed from dogs used by Magyar tribes. Vizslas were owned by sporting nobility of Hungary who used them to hunt with. They were also used to hunt deer, wild boar and wolf. The breed was almost wiped out during the First World War and again in the Second. Dogs were smuggled out of Hungary during the second war and used to breed in other countries.

Hungarian Vizsla's are russet gold. Some dogs may also have small white marks on their feet and/or chest.
They are active, enthusiastic, friendly. Vizslas need human interaction to stay happy and therefore do not make good kennel dogs.

Daily exercise and mental stimulation are needed. Indoors, Vizslas can be quite inactive, preferring to rest beside their owners, whilst others can be quite demanding of attention. Outside they are very active. If Vizslas do not receive sufficient mental and physical exercise, they will become bored, and what they choose to do to amuse themselves will usually be seen by you as destructive - such as digging or chewing.

A blonde person is someone with light coloured hair. When referring to a male, it is spelled blond without the -e. Some people are blonde because they have less pigment in their hair than dark haired people. To be blonde is usually to have blonde ancestors. Then it is genetic - blondes have genes that make them blond. Sometimes it is not genetic - this is called albinism. People can also use chemicals to make themselves blonde. Bleach is sometimes used to make the color of a persons hair lighter.
Most people are not blondes by their genes. Only some people with Caucasian ancestry are blondes by their genes, and also some Australian Aborigines have a different gene that makes them blonde. Natural blondes are most common around the Baltic Sea, especially the Nordic countries such as Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Iceland, and Finland and Ireland also has a number of natural blondes. According to recent genetic analysis, both mtDNA and Y chromosome exist in Austrians. Baltic countries, Slavic countries (especially Poland) and northwestern parts of Russia.

A Microformat is an attempt to re-use existing content in HTML and XML documents. Such content may be information on how to contact someone, or it may be geographical coordinates, for example. This information can then be processed by software more easily.
Technically, this kind of information is already there. A microformat aims at making this information accessible more easily. That way, tags might be added to flag the information.

Here, the formatted name ("fn"), organisation ("org"), telephone number ("tel") and web address ("url") have been identified using specific class names and the whole thing is wrapped in codice_1, which indicates that the other classes form an hCard (short for "HTML vCard)") and are not merely coincidentally named. Other, optional, hCard classes also exist. It is now possible for software, such as browser plug-ins, to extract the information, and transfer it to other applications, such as an address book.

"Get Smart" was a television series that was shown on NBC from September 18, 1965 to April 12, 1969. It was then shown on CBS from September 26, 1969, to September 11, 1970. It made fun of the secret agent genre. It starred Don Adams as Maxwell Smart, Barbara Feldon as Agent 99, and Edward Platt as the chief. Max Smart worked for a secret organization called CONTROL. Their enemy was KOAS. In 1980, a movie "The Nude Bomb" was released in theaters. In 1989, a television movie was shown called, "Get Smart, Again!". Because of the good success of the movie, FOX created a new TV series called "Get Smart", which featured Don Adams as Max Smart, now chief of CONTROL. A movie, based on the series was released on June 20, 2008. It starred Steve Carell as Max Smart, Anne Hathaway as Agent 99 and Alan Arkin as the chief.

Black people are a ethnic group, like white people and Hispanics. Black people usually have dark skin and broad noses, but can also have light skin and moderate noses.
Black people originated in Africa. They were the victims in the major slave trade, which resulted in many black people living in the United States and the Caribbean. In the United States, there was a civil rights movement. One of the leaders of this movement was Martin Luther King. The movement took place in the 1960s, after black people had been treated badly and not considered equal for many years. This is known as racism. Currently black people have equal rights in all major countries, but still often face discrimination.

Middle English is an older type of the English language that was spoken after the Norman invasion in 1066 until the middle/late 1400s. It came from Old English after William the Conqueror came to England with his French nobles and stopped English from being taught in schools for a few hundred years. Over this time, English borrowed several French words.
In the 1470s, the "Chancery Standard," a type of English spoken in London, started to become more common. This was partly because William Caxton brought the printing press to England in the 1470s. The type of English that people spoke in England between then and 1650 is called Early Modern English. There were many different dialects of Middle English.
Geoffrey Chaucer wrote The Canterbury Tales in Middle English.

Muskox ("Ovibos moschatus") are large, long-haired, horned mammals that are well-adapted to their cold, Arctic environment. They are found in the far north of Canada, Alaska, Greenland, Norway, Siberia, and some Arctic islands.

Musk oxen are herbivores (plant-eaters) that graze on grasses, willow leaves, and some Arctic flowers. They are ruminants; they swallow their food without chewing it. Later, they regurgitate the food (called a cud) and chew it. Musk Oxen, like other ruminants, have a four-part stomach.

Musk oxen travel in herds. The herd protects the young from predators, like wolves. When in danger, a herd will close ranks, with the musk oxen on the perimeter of the group facing outwards.

A religious denomination (also simply denomination) is a subgroup within a religion that has a common name, tradition, and identity.
The term is often used for several Christian denominations (for example, Eastern Orthodoxy, Catholicism, and the many sorts of Protestantism like Baptist, Methodist, Episcopalian and Pentecostal.
It is also used for the four branches of Judaism (Orthodox, Conservative, Reform and Reconstructionist), and (less often for the two main branches of Islam (Sunni and Shia).
In Hinduism the major deity or philosophical belief functions as the identifier of a denomination and typically each has distinct cultural and religious practices. The major denominations include Shaivism, Shaktism, Vaishnavism, Smartism, and Halumatha.

A triangle is a shape. It has three straight sides and three points. The three angles of a triangle add to 180 degrees. It is the polygon with the least possible number of sides.

Triangles can be grouped according to how long their sides are
Triangles can also be grouped by their angles.

Triangles are extremely useful, because the ratio of the length of sides to an angle is always the same. Measuring objects using triangles is called Trigonometry. Some people have spent their entire lives studying triangles for use in trigonometry.
Modern computers usually use triangles to make more complex graphic images or shapes.

Controlled natural languages (CNLs) are artificial languages built by simplifying the grammar and reducing the number of words in the language to avoid ambiguity or complexity.
There are two types of controlled languages: some designed to help non-native speakers of a language, and some designed to enable automatic semantic analysis.
The first type of languages (often called "simplified" or "technical" languages) are used by businesses or industries to improve the quality of technical writing, and possibly simplify the (semi-)automatic translation to other languages. For example, the ASD Simplified Technical English, Caterpillar Technical English, and IBM's Easy English.
These languages guide the writer by general rules such as "write short and simple sentences", "use the person's name ("John Smith" for example) instead of saying "him", and "talk about who is doing something, rather than what is being done, unless you need to say what is being done".
The second type of languages have a well defined rules of construction and interpretation, and can be matched to formal languages, such as first-order logic. Those languages can be used to handle information, to support fully automatic checks to test that they are correct and to search for information easily.

The Second International (1889-1916) was an organization created in 1889 by socialist and labour parties who wanted to work together for international socialism. It continued the work of the dissolved First International, though taking out the still-powerful anarcho-syndicalist movement and unions, and was still there in 1916.
Among the Second International's most famous actions were its (1889) declaration of May 1 as International Labour Day and its (1910) declaration of March 8 as International Women's Day.
The International's permanent executive and information body was the International Socialist Bureau (I.S.B.), in Brussels and formed after the International's Paris Congress of 1900. Emile Vandervelde and Camille Huysmans of the Belgian Labour Party were its chair and secretary. Lenin was a member from 1905.

Hornsby is a suburb and shire located in the northern part of Sydney.

The name 'Hornsby' comes from a convict who became a constable. His name was Samuel Henry Horne, and he was given some land for helping catch two bushrangers, whose names were Dalton and MacNamara. He named the land he was given 'Hornsby Place' after himself.

The centre of the suburb is where Hornsby station, Hornsby Westfield, Hornsby Library and many business buildings are located. The eastern side of the train line is often called the 'modern part' of Hornsby, and Westfield and the Hornsby Library are located here, with many new towering apartment blocks. The western side of the railway line is home to Hornsby's main post office, court house, police station, council office, public swimming pool, TAFE college and many older shops and businesses. There is also an industrial area located on the far western part of Hornsby, with many large warehouses and factories.
Hornsby Hospital and Mt Wilga Rehabilitation Hospital are two hospitals in Hornsby.

Hornsby is a place of many cultures, and many people from around the world live there.
The current population of Hornsby is 18,702.

The Sutlej River (sometimes spelled as "Satluj River") (,, and) is the longest of the five rivers that flow through the region of Punjab in northern Republic of India and Pakistan. It is located north of the Vindhya Range, south of the Hindu Kush segment of the Himalayas, and east of the Central Makran range in Pakistan.
The Sutlej is sometimes known as the Red River.
It is the easternmost tributary of the Indus River.
The source of the river is at Lake Rakshastal in Tibet near Mount Kailas, and it flows generally west and southwest through the region of Greater Punjab. The region to its south and east is arid, and is known as the Great Indian Desert or Thar Desert.

The Beas River () is the second easternmost of the rivers of the Punjab region. The river rises in the Himalayas in central Himachal Pradesh, India, and flows for some 290 miles (470 km) to the Sutlej River in the west of the Indian Punjab state.

The waters of the Beas and Sutlej rivers as well as of the Ravi River are allocated to India under the Indus Waters Treaty between India and Pakistan.

Acid rain is where chemicals in the air combine with rain and make the water more acidic.
Normally, the pHvalue of rain is about 5.6, which means it is a weak acid. Other chemicals can make this a stronger acid if they react with it. When this rain falls to the ground, it can kill fish in the rivers, harm plants, and dissolve building materials. This is why many gravestones are unreadable.
The most common chemicals which do this are oxides of sulphur and nitrogen, which are put into the air by power stations and vehicles (such as cars). There are also some natural causes, like volcanoes and biological processes that happen on the land, in wetlands, and in the oceans.
Many countries are trying to reduce the amount of acid rain by agreeing to treaties, and by taking part in emissions trading. In the United States, many power stations use a process called Flue gas desulphurization (FGD) to reduce the sulphur in the gases that are made.
Acid rain can make forests grow slower, or even destroy them. This affects animals and their natural habitats. Acid rain can also pollute a water supply, and this may not be noticed because the water will look the same. It would also hurt or in some cases it has been known to burn people and kill small mammals such as cats and dogs and mice. It could be a contributing factor to other diseases such as Cancer and Alzheimer. It could corrode metals such as TV aerials, cars, but that will have to be very very strong acid.

Horseshoes are things worn by horses to protect their feet when they walk - like a shoe. They are made by a person called a blacksmith who makes them and nails or glues them on the horse's hoof (feet). Horseshoes are usually made from iron, rubber, plastic, rawhide or a combination of these.
People also put horseshoes over doorways, because a long time ago, many people thought it was a sign for good luck and it protected whoever walked under it from evil spirits. Horseshoes are also used in a game where you try to throw them on a poll.

Atheism is the belief that there is no deity (or god). "A-" is a Greek prefix meaning "without" and "theos" means "god", so when put together with the suffix "-ism" ("belief"), it means "without belief in gods". The opposite of atheism is theism.

Some people describe two kinds of atheism - "weak atheism" and "strong atheism".

In many places, it is (or was) a crime to be an atheist. In Europe during the Middle Ages, atheists could be killed by burning. Many countries still have laws against atheism. Atheism is becoming more common. In some countries such as the United Kingdom, Canada, the Netherlands and the United States, there are laws that protect atheists' rights not to have a religion. This means that atheists have the same rights under the law as everyone else. "Freedom of religion" in international law and treaties includes the freedom to not have a religion.

An Overdose is when someone takes too much of a certain drug. This may be done voluntarily (as an attempt of suicide) or involuntarily. The drug may be a drug taken to treat some medical condition, or it may be a drug taken for recreation. Overdoses are considered to be poisoning, usually. They may lead to death, depending on the drug used.
What to do with people who had an overdose.
If someone is thought to have had an overdose it is important to get them to a doctor, or hospital. It can be very hard to see what kind of drug was taken. Therefore, it can be hard for the doctor to find an antidote to give. For this reason, a packet (even if it is empty) of the drug should be taken.

Data compression is making data use less space on a data storage device. When we compress data, we make it smaller. Some reasons why data is compressed are: to make it download faster, to make it fit on floppy disks, and to make it easier to archive (keep). To make pictures and movies smaller, we often remove parts that the human eye cannot see. This is known as "lossy" compression and it is effective because of human limitations.
There are many different ways to compress data. The most common way is known as "zipping" data. You can also "unzip" data to use it again.
The output from "unzipping" a zip file are files identical to the original files, this is known as "lossless" compression.

A Coaxial cable is a special electrical cable. It is used to transmit signals. The cable is specially insulated. This makes it quite stiff. Today, coaxial cables are used for things like Cable TV. Coaxial cables can also be used for computer networks, but this is more rarely the case now, as twisted pair cables can be used there more easily.
Such cables are usually made of a conducting wire. Then there is some insulation, then there is another layer of conducting material. Finally there is the (insulating) mantle. Such cables are used as a high-frequency transmission line to carry a high-frequency or broadband signal. Because the electromagnetic field carrying the signal exists (ideally) only in the space between the inner and outer conductors, it cannot interfere with or suffer interference from external electromagnetic fields.
There are different types of coaxial cables, which satisfy different standards.

Tenerife is one of the seven Canary Islands. It is part of the province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, the capital of the province being on the island. The other province in the canary Islands is Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. The flag adopted by the island is that of a white St Andrew's cross on a navy blue background this is due to St Andrew being the patron saint of the island.
Geologically it grew up from a volcano, the Teide. This volcano has had many violent eruptions over its very long history, the most recent of those eruptions took place in 1909.
Island capital is Santa Cruz de Tenerife, other important cities are Puerto de la Cruz, La Orotava and La Laguna, all in the north of the island.
The island is currently dependant on the tourism industry for much of its income.
Tenerife has two international airports, one in the north near Santa Cruz, one in the south near the centres of tourism in Playa de Las Americas, Costa Adeje and Los Christianos.
The biggest tourist attractions are the volcano Teide (top is more than 3,000 m above sea level) and the Loro Parque in Puerto de la Cruz.

Other cities in Waterloo Region include Waterloo and Cambridge. Sometimes Kitchener, Waterloo, and Cambridge are known as the "technology triangle". It is on the Grand River, which leads to Lake Erie.

At first, Kitchener was called Berlin. When World War I started it seemed like a bad idea to have a city named after the capital of Germany. The city was renamed Kitchener, after a British general, Herbert Kitchener. Kitchener then slowly became a prosperous city as it is today.

A rapid transit system is planned to be added in the Waterloo Region.

Herefordshire (known as County of Herefordshire) is a county in the West Midlands region of England. It borders the English counties of Shropshire to the north, Worcestershire to the east, Gloucestershire to the south east and the Welsh counties of Gwent to the south west and Powys to the west. It is not to be confused with Hertfordshire, a county north of London.
It is pronounced (i.e. first syllable as in "herring", and -e- a separate syllable).
The county town of Herefordshire is the cathedral city of Hereford.

Historically, the Rivers Wye and Lugg were navigable but the wide seasonal variations in water levels mean that few craft larger than canoes and coracles are now used. There are canoe centres at, Glasbury-on-Wye, and Ross-on-Wye, as well as a rowing club in Hereford.
The early nineteenth century saw the construction of two canals, The and The but these were never successful and there are now few remains to be seen.

The M2 Machine Gun, or Browning.50 Caliber Machine Gun is a heavy machine gun designed towards the end of World War I by John Browning. It was nicknamed "Ma Deuce" by US troops or simply called "fifty-cal." in reference to its caliber.
The Browning.50 caliber machine gun has been used a lot as a vehicle weapon and for aircrafts by the United States from the 1920s to the present day. It was used during World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, as well as during operations in Iraq in the 1990s and 2000s. It is the primary heavy machine gun of NATO countries, and has been used by many other countries. It is still in use today, with only a few modern improvements.

William Shakespeare (April, 1564 - April 23, 1616) was an English writer. He wrote plays and also some poetry. Many people consider him to be the greatest English writer of all time and one of the greatest in the world. He wrote plays about history and tragedy and he wrote comedies. His poetry and plays are about being human, with feelings such as love, jealousy, anger, and much more. Children learn about him in schools around the world. Shakespeare wrote his works between about 1590 and 1613.
Who wrote "Shakespeare"?
About 150 years after Shakespeare died, some writers began to say that the works we call "Shakespeare" were not really written by William Shakespeare. They had various reasons for saying this. For example, the person who wrote "Shakespeare" knew a lot about other countries (especially Italy), but William Shakespeare never left England as far as we know.
Several other writers of "Shakespeare" have been suggested, such as Francis Bacon, Christopher Marlowe, and Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford. Most scholars believe that William Shakespeare did write the works that bear his name, but the idea that someone else "wrote Shakespeare" still gets discussed a lot.

Graffiti are marks or writing made on a wall with paint or spray paint (paint that is sprayed from a can). A single mark could be called a graffito but the word graffiti is usually used, meaning that there is more than one mark.
Graffiti can take the form of art, drawings or words. When done without a property owner's permission it is considered vandalism. Sometimes it is just a person's name or a rude word. Sometimes it is as a public political protest.

Graffiti has been found in very old cities. For example, in the Roman Empire, people wrote messages and drew caricatures on walls. It was used for good instead of vandalism. Probably the simplest graffiti is when a person cuts (or carves) the name of a lover on a tree with a knife.
Today, many graffiti are very complicated mixtures of writing and pictures. They are sometimes made by gangs and applied with spray-paint to buildings, bridges, street signs, and other areas. These are often signed with a "tag" (in graffiti slang, a signature), which is a shape special to an artist or group.
Graffiti can be thought of as a part of hip hop or street protest. It is often but not always illegal. Some cities have small areas where graffiti can be made. Sometimes graffiti are very beautiful. Some people pay graffiti artists to do graffiti on their buildings. In the 1980s, some graffiti artists like Keith Haring became very famous.

A crotchet or quarter note is a note played for one fourth of a whole note (or "semibreve"). Quarter notes are written as a filled-in oval (or round) note head and a straight, flagless stem (the line). The stem usually points up (like a d) if it is below the middle line of the stave or down (like a p) if it is on or above the middle line.
When beginners start to learn to play an instrument they are often taught that one crotchet lasts for one beat (one count). That is because they are learning pieces with simple time signatures. It is, however, important to remember that other note lengths (minims, dotted crotchets etc) can also be treated as one beat, depending on the time signature.

Logarithms or logs are a part of mathematics. They are related to exponential functions, and useful in multiplying or dividing large numbers.

A logarithm tells what exponent (or power) is needed to make a certain number, so logarithms are the inverse (opposite) of exponentiation
Just as an exponential function has three parts, a logarithm has three parts. The three parts of a logarithm are a base, an argument and an answer.
In this function, the power is 3, the answer is 8.
In this logarithm, the base is 2, the argument is 8 and the answer is 3.

Logarithms can make multiplication and division of large numbers easy because adding logarithms is the same as multiplying, and subtracting logarithms is the same as dividing.
Before calculators became cheap and common, people used logarithm tables in books to multiply and divide. The same information in a logarithm table was available on a slide rule, a tool with logarithms written on it.

Logarithms to base "e" are called natural logarithms. The number e is nearly 2.71828, and is also called the Eulerian constant after the mathematician Leonhard Euler.

Pubic hair is that which covers the area around the sex organs. It is generally darker in color and stronger in texture than other hair found on the human body. The main purposes of pubic hair are nature's way of providing protection to a delicate part of the body as well as to reduce natural odors from the sex organs.
Pubic hair appears during the growth spurt of puberty in girls as well as boys. Beginning as a few sparse hairs, the region quickly fills out in a triangular shape eventually forming a noticable bush of hair.
The growth of hair can grow upwards toward the navel, but will always continue to grow down past the pubic region and ending at the anus (the hole between the buttocks). In females hair will cover the outer lips of the vagina; in males hair will surround the base of the penis and lightly cover the scrotum (the outer sack containing the testicles (also called the "balls" or "nuts").
Some people may change the appearance of their pubic hair by trimming or shaping it, although a vast majority will continue to have a pronounced growth due to the relatively quick rate of hair growth in the area, as well as the desire to be seen as a mature adult.
Pubic hair is sometimes called a "bush," "nest," "pubes," or "curlies."

The French Constitution of 1791 was the very first written Constitution of France. It was an important result of the French Revolution and adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen as its introduction.
This Constitution meant the creation of a French constitutional monarchy. The main controversy was the level of power to be granted to the King of France in such a system.
After very long negotiations, the long expected first Constitution was brought in September of 1791.
The principle of Separation of powers was the basis for the Constitution: The National Assembly was the legislative body, the King and the Ministers made up the executive branch and the judicial branch was independent from the other two.
The constitution attempted to establish a liberal bourgeois constitutional monarchy, but this did not work out. On 10 August 1792 the monarchy of France ended.

Asian Dust (also yellow dust, yellow sand, yellow wind, or China dust storms) is a weather occurrence that happens each year. It affects much of East Asia during the spring. The dust comes from deserts in Mongolia, northern China, and Kazakhstan. The dust comes from surface winds and dust storms in the desert. The clouds are carried by eastward winds to China, Japan, east Russia and the Koreas. Smaller particles in the clouds can travel much further to places like the United States. In the last ten years, these dust storms have become a serious problem because they have picked up industrial pollutants. The dust storms in China have been called "yellow dust terrorism".

An electron microscope is a microscope that uses electrons. Electron microscopes are very powerful and can see very small objects, like cells in the body.

It is the original form of electron microscope. High voltage electrons are sent from a cathode towards the specimen. Part of the electrons passes through the specimen, and is collected by a detector. The image is then created using a computer. This image shows the internal structure of the specimen.

High voltage electrons are sent towards the specimen. The specimen sends back low voltage electrons, which are collected by a detector. The image shows the characteristics of the "surface" of the specimen.

High voltage electrons are sent towards the specimen. Part of the electrons is reflected (sent back), which is collected by a detector. The resulted image shows the characteristics of the surface of the specimen.
Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope (STEM).
It combines the high resolution of TEM with the rastering functions of SEM. It can be used to perform complex analyses on the specimen, which cannot be done using TEM alone.

In music, portamento is a gradual slide from one note to another. It is very similar to a glissando, but a glissando is deliberately written in the music by the composer and may be a long slide between two or three octaves or more. A portamento is a much shorter slide, usually between two notes which are quite close. Opera singers often used to slide from one note of a tune to another instead of singing each note separately and clearly. The habit of putting in portamento between notes spread to other instruments as well. When listening to recordings of violin playing from the early 20th century we can hear that the players used a lot of portamento.
Over the last half century portamento has gone out of fashion and singers and instrumentalists are taught not to slide from one note to another. However, there are some places, especially in opera, where it can be effective so long as it is not done all the time. It is a matter of taste.

Archery is the practice of using a bow to shoot arrows. Archery has historically been used in hunting and combat and has become a precision sport. A person practicing archery is called an "archer", and one who is fond of or an expert at archery is sometimes called a "toxophilite".

The earliest evidence of archery dates back more than 5,000 years. The bow probably was used in hunting first and was then adopted as a tool of warfare. It was one of the earliest forms of artillery.
Classical civilizations, notably the Persians, Macedonians, Nubians, Greeks, Parthians, Indians, Japanese, Chinese, and Koreans, fielded large numbers of archers in their armies. Arrows proved exceptionally destructive against massed formations, and the use of archers often proved decisive.

A hinge is something that connects two objects and lets them rotate. The most common examples are the hinges that connect doors to walls or door frames. To open a door on hinges, one pushes the side far from the hinges and the door rotates around the side with hinges.
Hinges can be very large or very small. Small hinges are used for jewelery boxes and other small things with lids. Very large hinges have been used at the bottom of buildings, to let a building sit on loose soil or mud without breaking.

Premier is sometimes used instead of Prime Minister. But it is also the title of the leader of the government in some territories.

When a colony is first allowed to elect its own government the head of the government is called the "Chief Minister". As the colony gets more able to rule itself it is given more powers and the title of the Chief Minister is changed to "Premier". When the colony becomes independent the Premier becomes a Prime Minister, and British government ministers lose any authority to rule the new country.

The leader of the federal governments in Australia and Canada is called the prime minister, but the leader of the governments in Australian States and Canadian Provinces is called the Premier. This is because the states and provinces are not independent.

"Premier" can also mean first or best, as in Premier Division or premier quality

An attribute-value system is a basic knowledge representation framework comprising a table with columns designating "attributes" (also known as "properties", "predicates," "features," "dimensions," "characteristics" or "independent variables" depending on the context) and rows designating "objects" (also known as "entities," "instances," "exemplars," "elements" or "dependent variables."). Each table cell therefore designates the value (also known as "state") of a particular attribute of a particular object.

Below is a sample attribute-value system. It represents 10 objects (rows) and five features (columns). In this example, the table contains only integer values. In general, an attribute-value system may contain any kind of data, numeric or otherwise. An attribute-value system is distinguished from a simple "feature list" representation in that each feature in an attribute-value system may possess a range of values (e.g., feature formula_1 below, which has domain of), rather than simply being "present" or "absent"

The American Bison is a bovine mammal, also known as the American Buffalo, or simply Buffalo, something of a misnomer as it is only distantly related to either of the two "true buffalos": the Water Buffalo and the African Buffalo. Staples grasses and sedges.

Bison are considered a keystone species they once roamed the continent in great herds, and their grazing pressure helped shape the ecology of the Great Plains. The bisons has a large head with relatively small, curving horns. Its dark brown coat is long and shaggy on the forequarters, including the front legs, neck, and shoulders, wile the rest of the body has shorter, finer hair.

Bison once roamed across much of North America. Today bison are ecologically extinct throughout most of their historic range, except for a few national parks and other small wildlife areas.

The finite element method is the numerical method of solving systems of differential equations. They are used extensively in many fields of engineering because they require very little knowledge of mathematics beyond basic algebra to use. It belongs to the Methods of Weighted residuals in that the problem is formulated such that some conditions are satisfied exactly others are satisfied only approximately or numerically. I.e. the 'residual' being the difference between the exact solution and the approximate solution is weighted and minimized to get the best approximation.
While the ease of setting up a problem using finite elements and getting a solution is the reason for its popularity, its is also the cause of its frequent misuse and distrust of the answers obtained. Typically, it is recommended or required that experimental verification be performed before a model is acceptable for use. It is the author's observation that the use finite elements in structural analysis is in particular poorly managed. Engineers typically begin working with FE having very little knowledge of numerical methods or knowledge of finite element behavior. There are no standards and guidelines for modeling and few managers who understand well enough to regulate modeling. It has lead to mistrust of the method, its arrested development, and some very bad analysis being performed that is sadly emulated. Much aircraft structural design is analyzed using FE.

Chatham County, North Carolina
Chatham County is a county in the U.S. state of North Carolina. In 2000, the population was 49,329. Now the population is more than 60,000. Its county seat is Pittsboro.

The county was made in 1771 from Orange County.
In 1907 parts of Chatham County and Moore County were combined to form Lee County.

Chatham County is part of the regional Triangle J Council of Governments.

Chatham County has its own public school system for grades kindergarten to 12. Central Carolina Community College also has two campuses in the county.

Chatham County has the only coal mines in North Carolina. Coal mining used to be very important to the county, but in the 1920s a bad accident in one of the mines killed many workers. By the 1940s all the mines had closed. Some people have tried to open the mines back up, but the mines are too dangerous. Right now none of the mines are open.

Many builders are building new houses in Chatham County right now. Some people in the county do not like this beacause they do not want Chatham County to have a lot of people. A lot of people want to live in Chatham County because they do not have to pay as much tax as people in other North Carolina counties do. But other people think it is good that a lot of people want to live in the county because then the county will make more money from taxes.

A club (also known as cudgel, baton, truncheon, night stick, and bludgeon) is a weapon used for mainly used to hit someone or something. A club is a short staff, or stick, usually made of wood, and used as a weapon.
A club can be used in one or two hands, but it is usually used in one hand. Clubs that need both hands to be used are called quarterstaffs in English. Many kinds of clubs are used in martial arts and other fields, including the law enforcement baton.
The wounds caused by a club are known as "bludgeoning" or "blunt-force trauma" injuries.

Grand Theft Auto is a series of video games. The first was released in the late 90s which was top-down meaning it was like playing the game from a helicopter. The second was called "GTA 2" and also a add-on pack was added for the first game called "GTA: London" which was set in the 60s.
Then came the next games which were made in 3D which changed the way Grand Theft Auto was played. The first in the 3D series was called "Grand Theft Auto III" which was set in Liberty City which is like New York. Then there was ' which was set in the early 80s. It was very much like Miami in Florida. The latest game in the 3D series is called ' which is based on Los Angeles, San Francisco and Las Vegas. This game was a really big improvement from the older game because the map was so much bigger.
"Grand Theft Auto IV" ("GTA IV") was officially announced at the Microsoft 2006 E3 Press Conference on May 10, 2006. Grand Theft Auto IV is now being sold inside stores starting now...
There has been a lot of arguing, or "controversy," about these games. Many people do not like how the player can murder random people, and sleep with prostitutes. Because of this, all 3-D GTA games have been rated Mature so far.

Dodgeball is a sport played by throwing soft balls at people in a square court. The goal is to be the last one to be hit with the ball. Players may only throw balls at people who are not on their own team. If a player is hit by the ball, he or she should go to the outside of the court to the other team. From the outside, players throw the ball at players still on the inside.
Dodgeball is often played in elementary schools. It is thought to be good for physical education. Many school children play this game. In recent years, many adults who played it as children have formed adult leagues and clubs. Also, some schools have banned it (this means that made it against the rules to play it), because some kids got hurt when playing the game. Tournaments are sometimes held in schools, famously pitting the villainous Wrestlers up against the ragtag Avengers in a truly David vs Goliath matchup. Folklore has blurred fact from fiction, yet the truth remains that the Avengers overcame a 5 on 2 handicap in a stunning comeback fashion.
Dodgeball, because of its recent popularity, inspired a film ' (2004) starring Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn, and a game show, "Extreme Dodgeball".

A Wild Weasel is a nickname for an aircraft in the United States Air Force that is supposed to destroy enemy anti-aircraft guns, surface-to-air missiles, and other ground attack weapons by seeking them out with radar and destroying them with missiles.

The idea was first though of in 1965 during the Vietnam War, because North Vietnamese surface-to-air missiles, or "SAMs" were destroying American aircraft. The first Wild Weasel airplane was the F-100 Super Sabre, a variant of the F-86 Sabre. In 1966, the F-105 Thunderchief took the job.
After that, a new kind of F-4 Phantom IIs, the "G" model was used as a Wild Weasel. During the Gulf War of 1991, Wild Weasel missions were done by the F-16 Fighting Falcon, a light fighter-bomber that can also battle enemy fighter aircraft. Currently, the F-16 still does this. They are being used in the Iraq War.

In the Vietnam War, the main missile used by Wild Weasels was the AGM-45 Shrike. Currently, some of the weapons used by the Wild Weasel planes includes the AGM-88 HARM and the AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missiles. They can also have ALQ-131 and ALQ-184 pods that can mess up enemy radar.

Entomology is the science of insects. People who study insects are called entomologists. Insects have been studied since prehistoric times, but it was not until as early as the 16th century that insects were scientifically studied.
Some entomologists study how insects are related to each other. Others study how insects live and reproduce, because we do not know very much about some kinds of insects. Other entomologists study ways to keep insects away from crops that people use for food.There are billions of unknown species throughout the world and taxonimists catagorize the newly found.
Entomologists meet to talk about their study of insects and to share ideas, just as all scientists do.

Eurasia is a continent in the northern part of the Earth. Eurasia is made of Europe and Asia, which are on the same tectonic plate and do not have a sea between them, so they are scientifically one continent. The word is made by adding "Eur" (from "Eur"ope) to "Asia" to make "Eurasia".
Some geographers say it's all just one continent, because unlike the Americas or Africa, Europe and Asia are not divided by sea. The Ancient Greeks divided the world they knew into Europe, Asia and Africa. Since then, people have been talking about Asia and Europe as two continents so it is now a tradition.
Some other continents are not completely divided by sea and are joined together and by a thin strip of land (called an isthmus) like North America and South America. However, Europe and Asia are not divided by sea at all.
Sometimes Eurasia is divided into West Eurasia and East Eurasia. West Eurasia is Europe and the Middle East. Historians sometimes add North Africa to West Eurasia because the Sahara Desert divides North Africa from the other parts of Africa and it is as difficult to cross as a sea.

Henry I of England (c. 1068 C.E. - 1 December 1135 C.E.) was the King of England from 1100 until his death in 1135. Henry was born in Selby, Yorkshire. He was the third son of William the Conqueror and Queen Matilda of Flanders.
He became King when his brother, William II, died in a hunting accident. As King, Henry tried to make social reforms. He issued the Charter of Liberties which is considered a predecessor of the Magna Carta. He put back in place some of the laws of Edward the Confessor.
Henry and his wife had two children, Matilda and William Adelin. He also fathered more illegitimate children than any other English King. Guesses place the number between 20 and 25.
Henry died in 1135 while visiting his daughter and grandchildren in Normandy. After his death, his daughter Mathilda and his nephew, Stephen, argued over who would become the ruler of England, and started a civil war.

An anaerobic organism is any living thing that does not need oxygen for growth.
Microaerophiles are organisms that may use oxygen, but only at low concentrations (low micromolar range); their growth is inhibited by normal oxygen concentrations (approximately 200 micromolar). Nanaerobes are organisms that cannot grow in the presence of micromolar concentrations of oxygen, but can grow with and benefit from nanomolar concentrations of oxygen.
Obligate anaerobes may use fermentation or anaerobic respiration. In the presence of oxygen, facultative anaerobes use aerobic respiration; without oxygen some of them ferment, some use anaerobic respiration. Aerotolerant organisms are strictly fermentative. Microaerophiles carry out aerobic respiration, and some of them can also do anaerobic respiration.
Some anaerobic bacteria produce toxins (e.g., tetanus or botulinum toxins) that are highly dangerous to higher organisms, including humans.

A brush can be a lot of different things. All brushes have a long part at one end to hold (the handle), and hairs or bristles (short, hard hairs or pieces of plastic) on the other end (the head), and we use them for cleaning, making hair look good, or painting.

There are a lot of sorts of brushes for cleaning, for example toothbrushes or brushes for cleaning the floor.

We use paint brushes for putting ink or paint on paper. In computer software there are sometimes ditigal paintbrushes for making pictures, too.

We can buy brushes in different sizes and materials. Here are some sorts.
Decorators' brushes.
The sizes of brushes used for painting and decorating (changing the colour or look of a room) are usually in mm or inches. This shows how wide the head is.
We can buy brushes with natural or synthetic (man-made) bristles. Handles (the part of the brush we hold) may be wood or plastic.
Artists' brushes.
Artists' brushes usually have sizes with numbers, but there is no standard.
We use sizes "000" to "20" most often.
Bristles may be natural -- either soft hair or hog (pig) bristle -- or synthetic (man-made).
Artists' brush handles (the part of the brush we hold) are often wooden, but the cheapest brushes may have plastic handles. Many cheap handles are made of unfinished wood; better quality handles are of finished wood.

The Indian Chameleon, "Chamaeleo zeylanicus" is a species of chameleon found in Sri Lanka, India and other parts of South Asia. Like other chameleons, this species has a long tongue, feet that are shaped into bifid claspers and a prehensile tail. Its two eyes can move in different directions at the same time. It also can change the colour of its skin. They move slowly with a bobbing or swaying movement and are usually arboreal. Strangely, although they can change color, they may not be able to see differences in colour. They are usually in shades of green or brown or with bands. They can change colour quickly. The main reason for colour change is for communication with other chameleons and for controlling body temperature. By changing to dark colours, their bodies absorb heat.

An adjudicator is someone who decides on a winner at a competition for music or theatre. The adjudicator will always be somebody who has a lot of experience in what he is adjudicating. In big international festivals, a team of several adjudicators may decide together on the winners. In amateur competitions, the adjudicator may also talk to the competitors after they have performed and give them advice. Competitors are often given first, second and third prizes.
In Law, an adjudicator is someone who decides who is right when a group of people cannot agree on something.

Soil erosion (or simply erosion) is the washing or blowing away (by the wind) of the top layer of soil (dirt).
This is a serious problem for people who want to grow crops.

If the soil has eroded, the crops will not grow very well.
Erosion also leaves large holes in the earth, which can weaken buildings and even cause them to collapse. Another type of erosion is called Decomposition and is when waves wash away sand and other material from cliffs or beaches.

Soil erosion can be prevented several ways.

Nordic countries are a group of countries in the northern Europe. These countries are Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Sweden and Norway. Scandinavia is not the same thing as Nordic countries even though some people say they are. Scandinavia is a peninsula while Nordic countries are countries. Sweden and Norway (and a small part of Finland) are located at Scandinavian peninsula. Scandinavia and Finland together belong to bigger peninsula that is Fennoscandia.
Nordic countries have similar state, law and culture. In history Nordic countries have gone many times together. Nordic countries are welfare states with a very high taxes. Nordic countries have some political co-operation, like Nordic council, but not very much. Co-operation with a larger group European Union makes Nordic co-operation even smaller. Finland is the only country that uses the euro.
There is a long and cold winter in Nordic countries, but only a small part of northern Norway and about a half of Iceland is arctic.

Frank Vincent Zappa (December 21, 1940 - December 4, 1993) was an American musician and composer. He was known for his strange style of music, which was often weird and funny. He made various types of music and many albums. Zappa worked with many other musicans, most notably his 1960s group The Mothers of Invention and his friend and blues singer Captain Beefheart.
Zappa was born in Baltimore, Maryland, but spent most of his life in Southern California. He grew up in the desert town of Palmdale, California. Zappa wrote a very funny song about his life there. It was called "Let's Make The Water Turn Black". It was a true story about two brothers who did some strange things. Zappa had four children with his wife Gail. They gave them all very unusual names: Moon Unit, Dweezil, Ahmet, and Diva.
His most popular song was probably a song he sang in the early 1980s with his daughter, Moon Unit, called "Valley Girl,". The song was based on Moon Unit making fun of some local girls at her school.
Zappa was openly against things like drugs, guns, and censoring music. He often tried to see what he could get away with, which sometimes got him in trouble.

The fin whale ("Balaenoptera physalus") is a huge baleen whale. It is the second largest animal on Earth (the blue whale is the biggest). This whale is sometimes called the "greyhound of the sea" because of its fast swimming speed; it can swim up to 23 mph (37 km/hr) in short bursts. The fin whale is also called the finback, finner, razorback, common rorqual, and herring whale.

The fin whale is a streamlined whale that is found worldwide except in polar waters; it is most common in the Southern Hemisphere. There are three separate populations of fin whales, one in the northern Pacific, one in the North Atlantic, and one in the Southern Hemisphere; they do not interbreed. Many groups of fin whales migrate between feeding grounds and breeding grounds. This whale usually swims in pods of 3-7 whales but larger groups (up to 300 animals) may form at rich feeding grounds or while migrating.

Fin whales are carnivores that filter-feed plankton (tiny crustaceans like krill, copepods, pteropods, etc.) and small fish from the water. They have very fine grey-black baleen that traps very small particles of food. Each side of the upper jaw has 350-400 baleen plates.

The Battle of the Philippine Sea was an important naval battle of the Second World War between by the navies of the United States and Japan. This battle took place on June 19 and June 20 1944 near the Mariana Islands, and involved two big naval forces and many Japanese aircraft from bases on land. The battle was a great defeat for the Japanese Navy, which lost three aircraft carriers and some 600 aircraft in two days of combat. This happened because the Japanese airplanes were getting old and their pilots had little training, compared to the more modern and better trained American forces. After the battle, the Japanese Navy was almost completely destroyed. This victory for Allied forces opened the door for the invasion of Iwo Jima.

Electronic mail (or e-mail or email) is an Internet service that allows those people who have an e-mail address (accounts) to send and receive electronic letters. Those are much like postal letters, except that they are delivered much faster than snail mail when sending over long distances, and are usually free. To send or receive an email, you need a gadget (computer, phone etc) connected to the Internet and an e-mail program (simply called mailer). Several formats exist for email addresses. The most common, called RFC 2822, looks like user@domain.com. E-mail messages are sent mostly by text, and sometimes by HTML style.
Like with regular mail, users may get a lot of unwanted mail. With e-mail, this is called spam. Some programs used for sending and receiving mail can detect spam and filter it out nearly completely.
Some companies let you send and receive emails for free from a remote website. Gmail, Hotmail and Yahoo! do this kind of service: known as "web mail".

Ternopil is a city in western Ukraine. It is also the administrative centre of the Ternopil region. The city has about 245,000 inhabitants (2004) and is situated on the Siret River.

The city was part of the Austrian Habsburg Empire from 1772 until 1918, and it belonged to Poland before 1772. When the Austrain empire fell in 1918, Turnopil beccame part of the short-lived ZUNR (Western Ukrainian National Republic). After heavy battles between Polish troops and Ukrainian Galician Army troops, the city was occupied by Poland in 1920. However, it was only part of Poland for less than 20 years, and in September 1939, it was taken by Soviet troops and annexed to the USSR. Ternopil became part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, it became a part of Independent Ukraine.

Computers use codes, by changing letters into 1's and 0's. This is called an ASCII code.
Some people write codes as a kind of game. They think it is fun to make codes, and fun to break codes. Breaking a code means taking it apart to understand how it works, and then you can understand messages that are written in that code.
In the United States, there is an organization called the NSA. Their job is to break other people's codes, and to make codes that the United States government can use, which are hard to break.
The algorithm (code) for making a message secret is called the encryption algorithm. To change a secret message back a decryption algorithm is needed.
When you change the message back you most likely use a cypher (commonly spelled as cipher). The word Cypher is also in French as "cifre" and Latin as "cifra," from the Arabic word "sifr" (zero).

The national flag of Oman () consists of three stripes (white, green and red) with a red bar on the left that contains the national emblem of Oman. The white stands for peace and prosperity, the green for fertility and the Green Mountains, and the red for battles against foreign invaders. The red is also the colour of the former flag of the nation when it was known simply as the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman.
Until 1970, Oman used the plain red banner of the indigenous people, the Kharijite Muslims. In 1970, the Sultan introduced a complete new set of national flags. Bands of green and white were added to the fly, and the national emblem, the badge of the Albusaidi Dynasty, was placed in the canton. This depicts crossed swords over a gambia, a traditional curved dagger. White has been associated historically with the Imam, the religious leader of Oman and at times the political rival to the ruling Sultan. It also symbolizes peace. Green is traditionally associated with the Jebel al Akhdar, or "Green Mountains," which lie toward the north of the country. Red is a common color in Gulf state flags. The national emblem is said to date back to the 18th century. A curved dagger is fastened over a pair of crossed swords. An ornate horsebit links the weapons.

A glove is a piece of clothing that covers a hand. There are many different kinds of gloves. Gloves are made of many different fabrics and materials, and gloves are used in many ways.

People wear thick gloves, usually made of wool or fabric, to keep their hands warm in cold weather. They wear thin gloves (usually made of rubber or plastic) to keep their hands clean. People also wear thin gloves made of rubber or plastic to keep things they touch clean. Some workers wear gloves made of heavy rubber to protect their hands from chemicals. A mitten is a glove which has a separate place for the thumb, but the other four fingers are together. There are also mittens, which are very similar to gloves. Gloves and mittens are usually used to protect people from cold, and chemicals. People use latex gloves during Earth day to clean up.

There are also gloves that are worn for fashion, because they look good. These type of gloves are made from leather, fur, or different fabrics.

Gray or grey is the color of black and white mixed together.
Gray is the color of an elephant, cement, and pencil writing. Gray often looks like someone made white darker, but not so dark that it is black.
In the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Ireland, and New Zealand, as well as a few other countries, this word is spelled grey. In the United States, it is spelled gray.

The color gray represents "pessimism"; its opposite, "optimism", is represented by the color rose.

Hydraulic head is a specific measurement of water pressure or total energy per unit weight above a datum.
It is usually measured as a water surface elevation, expressed in units of length, but represents the energy at the entrance (or bottom) of a piezometer. In an aquifer, it can be calculated from the depth to water in a piezometric well (a specialized water well), and given information of the piezometer's elevation and screen depth.

Even though it is conventional to use gauge pressure in the calculation of hydraulic head, it is more correct to use total pressure (gauge pressure + atmospheric pressure), since this is truly what drives groundwater flow. Often detailed observations of barometric pressure are not available at each well through time, so this is often disregarded (contributing to large errors at locations where hydraulic gradients are low or the angle between wells is acute.)

Golant is a small village in Cornwall, England. It is located in the parish of St Sampson on the banks of the Fowey estuary. It is between St. Austell and Polperro and is close to Bodmin. The church in the villiage is dedicated to St. Sampson.
Golant railway station was at one time by the river to the south of the village. It was served by trains on the Great Western Railway's Fowey branch line from 1 July 1896 until 4 January 1965. The station has since been removed. The space is now used for a car park.
Annie Vernon, the Olympic rower, first learn her sport at Golant's Castle Dore Rowing Club.

Until very recently, Golant has been almost unknown except to the people who live there and pilgrims and other walkers of the Saints' Way. Nearby, there is a little used ford across the Fowey estuary. In late summer 1644, during the first English Civil War, war came to Golant and the area around the village. A large group of about 10,000 Parliamentary soldiers fought against the forces of King Charles on the peninsula between Lostwithiel, St. Blazey and Fowey. King Charles was in the area at the time.

Shamanism is the name for a number of religious movements. Originally, it was used by Europeans to describe different religious and magical movements they could observe with certain indigenous people in Siberia, from about the 17th century. In the 20th century, the word was also used to describe other, similar movements worldwide.
Shamans play a central role in these movements, as they can be in both worlds, this one, and the world of spirits.
Shamanism is different form animism or animatism. Unlike these, it is not an organised movement.

Nuclear fission is when atoms split apart into smaller atoms. It gives off a lot of energy, and is used in nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors. This process was discovered in December 1938 by the German nuclear chemist Otto Hahn and his assistant Fritz Strassmann in Berlin.
Certain types of the elements named "uranium" and "plutonium" can be made to fission. All atoms are small, but atoms of uranium and plutonium are very heavy. At their center is a very heavy ball called a nucleus, which is made of protons and neutrons. If a very large nucleus is shot at with a neutron, it will sometimes break into two pieces. This will release a lot of energy, and also some more neutrons. If those neutrons then hit another atom, they will do the same thing, again and again. This is called a nuclear chain-reaction, and it can release a lot of energy very quickly. Forces are measured in kilotons. One kiloton is the same as the explosive force of one thousand tons of TNT (trinitrotoluene).
In a nuclear bomb, this must happen very quickly to make a very big explosion. In a nuclear reactor, this must happen very slowly to create heat. To create heat, uranium is used to boil water in the reactor.
In nuclear reactors, fission is used to create heat, which is used to make steam. The steam is then used to power electric turbines which generate electricity.

The Demographics of Pakistan are a study of the population and the people. It is estimated that Pakistan's population was over 170,000,000 in mid 2008. Pakistan had an estimated population of 169,300,000 as of July 2007. Between 1951-1998, the number of people in Pakistan's cities and towns (known as the urban population) increased sevenfold. And by the next decade the population is expected to exceed 176 million. In the past, the country's population had a quite high growth rate. Dramatic social changes have led to rapid urbanisation and the emergence of megacities. Between 1990-2003, Pakistan sustained its historical lead as the most urbanised nation in South Asia, with city dwellers making up 34% of its population.
Pakistan has a multicultural and multi-ethnic society and has one of the largest refugee populations in the world as well as a young population.
Pakistan's next national census will take place in 2008.

The majority of southern Pakistan's population lives along the Indus River. In the northern half, most of the population lives about an arc formed by the cities of Faisalabad, Lahore, Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Nowshera, Swabi, Mardan and Peshawar.

Time Cube is a website created by Gene Ray. On that website, Dr. Ray explains his "Time Cube" theory, which describes the planet Earth as having a cubic symmetry, and time as rotating four "corners". Many scientists reject these ideas, saying that they make no sense and cannot be tested.
The Time Cube website is written in an angry and hateful voice. On his site, Ray says that anyone who does not believe in Time Cube is "stupid and evil". Some of the comments are racist, especially against black people and Jews. There are also many comments against gay people. Many people find the site to be difficult to understand.
Ray has spoken about Time Cube at two universities in the United States, MIT and Georgia Tech. At MIT, a dean tried to cancel the lecture before it had taken place. Ray sees this as proof of a conspiracy to keep information about Time Cube hidden.

A Steam engine is an engine which uses steam power to operate. It can convert the energy present in heat (of water steam usually) into mechanical work. "Steam engines" were used on locomotives or steam boats, but also in factories to move pumps. They were the prime moving force behind the Industrial Revolution. A piston-operated steam engine is called "reciprocal" (back-and-forth) engine.
The steam to power a steam engine is made in a boiler. Water in the boiler is heated to make steam. The steam coming out of the boiler applies the force on a piston or turbine blade. Movement of the piston or the turbine blade is then used to turn wheels or drive other machinery. To boil the water in the boiler, several types of fuels may be used. It may be wood, coal, or oil.
Today almost all steam engines are turbines. They are used on power plants to operate generators which make electricity. Some ships, like large warships, are also powered by steam turbines.
The steam engines were invented by MR. James Watt and it was debutated at the period of the industrial revolution, an economic revolution.

Germanic paganism was a religion. It was a form of paganism. It was practiced in Central an Northern Europe before Christianity came there. The best documented form is called Norse paganism today. The religion was polytheistic, there were many gods. The main ones seem to have been Odin and Thor. Beforehand, the most important one may have been Tyr.

The Germanic gods have affected elements of every day western life in most countries that speak Germanic languages. An example is some of the names of the days of the week. The days were named after Roman gods in Latin (named after "Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn"). The names for Tuesday through Friday were replaced with Germanic versions of the Roman gods. In English and Dutch, Saturn was not replaced. Saturday is named after the Sabbath in German, and is called "washing day" in Scandinavia.
Also, many place names such as Woodway House, Wansdyke, Thundersley and Frigedene are named after the old deities of the English people.

A square is a shape with four equal sides and four corners that are all right angles (90 degrees). The diagonals of a square also cross at right angles. The angle between any diagonal and a side of a square is 45 degrees. In fact, a square is also a rectangle because rectangles only need to have two parallel sides equal.
A square can also mean an open place, usually in a town, that is shaped nearly like a square; often because of a crossroads. Examples include Trafalgar Square in London, Times Square in New York and Tiananmen Square in Beijing.
In English slang, "square" can also mean "equal". For example in sports "all square" means that the scores are even.

Quarks are smaller than atom particles that, for example, make up neutrons and protons.
Scientists had once believed that protons, neutrons, and electrons were fundamental particles that made up everything in the universe. This means that they cannot be broken down into simpler particles.
Then, they invented the particle accelerator and realized that there were, in fact, hundreds of other fundamental, even smaller particles that made up the protons and neutrons.
They found out that even these so called fundamental particles were actually just various arrangements of the even more basic quarks and leptons. There are six types of quarks (named Up, Down, Strange, Charm, Top and Bottom), and six types of leptons.

Codeine or methylmorphine is an opiate used for its analgesic properties. It is also used to treat coughing and diarrhea. It is marketed as the salts codeine sulfate and codeine phosphate. Codeine hydrochloride is more commonly marketed in continental Europe and other regions.
Codeine is an alkaloid found in opium in concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 3.0 percent. Codeine can be extracted from opium. Today, most codeine is synthesized from morphine through the process of O-methylation.

Codeine is sometimes marketed indrugs that combine it with paracetamol (acetaminophen) as co-codamol (best known in North America as Tylenol 3), with aspirin as co-codaprin or with ibuprofen. These combinations provide greater pain relief than either agent alone (drug synergy; see synergy).

Rodents are a group of mammals. They form the order Rodentia (row-den-she-a).
They have four incisors that keep growing, and must be kept worn down by gnawing (eroding teeth by grinding them on something hard); this is the origin of the name, from the Latin "rodere", "to gnaw", and "dent", "tooth".
Most rodents are small. Examples of commonly known rodents are mice, rats, chipmunks, and squirrels. Some other small rodents sometimes kept as pets are Guinea pigs, hamsters, and gerbils.
Examples of larger rodents are porcupines, beavers, and the largest living rodent, the capybara, which can grow to between 105 and 135 cm (40-55 in) in length, and weigh 35 to 65 kg (75-140 lbs).
Almost half of all mammal species are rodents. More examples of rodents are voles, prairie dogs, groundhogs, and chinchillas.
Rabbits, hares, and pikas are sometimes called rodents, because they also have teeth that keep growing. But in 1912 biologists decided to put them in a new, separate order, Lagomorpha, because they have two extra incisors in their upper jaw.
Shrews are sometimes called rodents, because they look like mice, but that is not correct. They are in the order Insectivora.

The Suzuki method, (or Talent Education, or the Mother Tongue method, or the Suzuki movement) is a way of teaching. It teaches people to be morally better through a caring environment. It normally uses a musical instrument such as the violin or piano to do this. It can also use other musical instruments like the flute, recorder, piano, guitar, cello, viola, bass, organ, harp and voice. The Suzuki method uses the same environment that people have when they learn their mother-tongue. This means that each student sees and hears music and good moral character all of the time. Other people tell them that they will do well. The students learn one thing at a time. They learn new things when they are ready. The term "Suzuki method" is also used to mean only the Suzuki sheet music books and songs.

Dr. Suzuki saw that all children learn their own language very quickly. Even dialects which adults thought were hard to learn are spoken with ease by 5 or 6 year old children. He thought that if a person can speak their mother tongue, then they can learn to play a musical instrument. He came up with the idea that any pre-school age child could begin to play the violin.

Metaphysics is a branch of philosophy and is the study of the world.
It is the basis of physics and other sciences.
However, unlike other sciences, metaphysics asks very basic philosophical questions and does not look at the world directly.
A physicist might ask 'how does the world work?' but a metaphysical philosopher would ask 'what is the world?'.
Often metaphysical questions are questions about ourselves, and how we see and feel the world.
They can also be questions about what might be true and what could not be true.
By answering these questions metaphysical philosophers hope they can understand the world in a way that people who do not ask them cannot.
Many metaphysical philosophers are also physicists, such as Aristotle and Rene Descartes.
In some areas metaphysical philosophers can ask questions and find answers but physicists cannot, such as the study of time or God.
In other areas metaphysics is not very useful, such as finding out what things are made of.

People call lady beetles many different names. Ladybird is the name used in the British Commonwealth for this group of beetles that often is red with black spots. In the United States of America, and in Canada (even though it is part of the British Commonwealth), people call these beetles ladybugs. Scientists often use the name lady beetle. In science, lady beetles are in the family Coccinellidae.

Most people know lady beetles as small, round, red beetles with black spots on their backs. Not all lady beetles are red, and not all red lady beetles have spots. Some lady beetles are very little and are black and hairy. Other lady beetles are red or yellow but have black stripes. Some red lady beetles have no spots or stripes at all!
Brittney roxOne of the most common lady beetles in much of North America is the seven-spotted lady beetle. Scientists call it "Coccinella septempunctata". The name means ("sept") "seven" ("punctata") "holes", because it looks like the beetle has seven black holes in its back.
Each ladybird is different and many have individual charming characteristics.

Almost all lady beetles are carnivores, which means they eat other animals. The animals lady beetles eat are other insects. Many of these insects have soft bodies, such as aphids. Even baby lady beetles eat other insects.

The First War of Scottish Independence lasted from the outbreak of the war in 1296 until the 1328.
The Scots were defeated at Dunbar on 27 April 1296. John Balliol abdicated in Montrose castle on 10 July 1296. John was imprisoned in the Tower of London at first, but then released into the custody of Pope Boniface VIII on condition that he remain in a papal residence. He was later released around the summer of 1301 and lived the rest of his life on his family's estates in Picardy.
But his supporters argued that he was still the rightful King of Scotland. Therefore the Scots rose in rebellion in 1297 under William Wallace and Andrew de Moray and said they claimed were acting on behalf of King John. But in fact Scotland had no monarch until the accession of Robert the Bruce in 1306.

The forehand in tennis is a shot made by swinging the racquet across one's body in the direction of where the player wants to place the shot. For a right-handed player, the forehand is a stroke that begins on the right side of his body, continues across his body as contact is made with the ball, and ends on the left side of his body. It is considered the easiest shot to master, perhaps because it is the most natural stroke. Beginners and advanced players often have better forehands than any other shots and use it as a weapon.

Introversion and Extroversion, made up by Carl Jung in the 1920s, is one theory that describes how a person gets energy from the world. Many people associate "introverts" with being quiet and shy, and "extroverts" with being loud and sociable. According to the theory, introverts get energy from inside themselves (ideas and concepts in their own minds), and extroverts get energy from outside of themselves (interacting with other people).
Those who follow this way of looking at the world say that everyone has some parts of both traits in them, though one will usually dominate over the other. At one time, extroverts were thought to make up almost three-fourths of American society. Now, researchers typically assume that the number of extroverts is pretty much equal to the number of introverts in the country.

The Arsacid Dynasty or (sometimes called the Arshakuni Dynasty) ruled the Kingdom of Armenia from 54 to 428. They used to be a branch of the Parthian Arsacids but became a distinctly Armenian dynasty later on. Arsacid Kings reigned intermittently throughout the chaotic years after the fall of the Artaxiad Dynasty until 62 when Tiridates I of Armenia secured Arsacid rule in Armenia. An independent line of Kings was established by Vologases II of Armenia (Valarses/Vagharshak) in 180. Two of the most notable events under Arsacid rule in Armenian history were the conversion of Armenia to Christianity by St. Gregory the Illuminator in 301 and the creation of the Armenian alphabet by Mesrop Mashtots in 405.

A county borough was a type of local government district in England until abolished in 1974.
Local government powers were divided between county councils and urban or rural districts.
For example: rural districts may not be able to maintain footpaths or street lighting because of their size. Urban districts were based in a town and were able handle these jobs. Schools were the responsibility of county councils because districts were too small to run all types of schools themselves.
A county borough was a town big enough to run all its own local government, so the local county council had no power inside the county borough.

Benjamin Franklin (January 17, 1706 - April 17, 1790) was one of the "Founding Fathers" of the United States, and one of the country's earliest politicians. He had a very important part in shaping the American Revolution, even though he was never elected to any official position. As a leader of the Enlightenment, he influenced European scientists. He even was the first thing many Europeans associated with America at the time. His success with the French military was an important factor in America's win over Great Britain.
Most people see Franklin as one of history's greatest inventors. Some of his greatest creations include the lightning rod, bifocals (a type of eyeglasses), the idea of unity in the Thirteen Colonies, and the idea of America itself.
The city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (where he lived) marked his three hundredth birthday in 2006.
Franklin is frequently seen on the United States' hundred-dollar bill as a mark of brilliance and a tribute to our past.

Clapham Junction is a railway station located in Battersea in the London Borough of Wandsworth. It is located on St. John's Hill in the south west of Battersea.

All services to Waterloo and many services to Victoria and Croydon stations pass through the junction; these include South West Trains, Gatwick Express and Southern services. Services from Clapham Junction also head north along the West London Line, through West Brompton and Kensington (Olympia), on to Willesden Junction and Watford Junction - services (to Willesden Junction) are operated by London Overground.

The station has 16 platforms, numbered 2 to 17, and arranged in two groups. Platform 1, the northernmost platform, is no longer used. It doesn't have any rails. If the planned East London Line extension gets to Clapham Junction, the platform may be used again.
The station's main entrance is from St. John's Hill, into a foot tunnel which is 15 ft (4.6 m) wide. It runs under the eastern end of the 17 platforms, and to a northern exit, which has restricted opening hours. The foot tunnel becomes very crowded during the morning and evening rush hours, and ticket barriers at the end of the tunnel are a particular pinch point.
A covered footbridge connects the platforms at their western end. Unfortunately the footbridge does not provide entry to or exit from the station.

A peasant is a name for a person that worked for others and never had much money. They usually wore rough cloths and live in small houses.
The word peasant came from the medieval era (15th century). Peasants worked on farms and had to be able to do a number of jobs on the farm. Peasants usually lived in the country region of their country and made up a large amount of the population.
Most peasants could not read or write. They did not usually talk with the higher society unless it was about work.

"Gardenia" is a genus of about 250 species of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. Gardenia can be found in the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, southern Asia, Australasia and Oceania.
The genus was named by Carl Linnaeus after "Dr Alexander Garden" (1730-1791), Scottish-born American naturalist.
They are evergreen shrubs and small trees growing to 1-15 m tall. The leaves are opposite or in whorls of three or four, 5-50 cm long and 3-25 cm broad, dark green and glossy with a leathery texture. The flowers are solitary or in small clusters, white or pale yellow. Flowering is from about mid-spring to mid-summer and many species are strongly scented.

Gardenia plants are prized for the strong sweet scent of their flowers, which can be very large in some species.
Gardenias have a reputation for being difficult to grow. Because they originated in warm humid tropical areas, they demand high humidity.

Megalodon was an ancient shark that may have been 40 feet (12 m) long or even more. (There are a few scientists who estimate that it could have been up to 50 or 100 feet (15.5 or 31 m) long!) This is at least two or three times as long as the Great White Shark, but this is only an estimate made from many fossilized teeth and a few fossilized vertebrae that have been found. These giant teeth are the size of a person's hand! No other parts of this ancient shark have been found, so we can only guess what it looked like. Since Megalodon's teeth are very similar to the teeth of the Great White Shark (but bigger and thicker), it is thought that Megalodon may have looked like a huge, streamlined version of the Great White Shark.

Hereford cattle are a widely used breed in temperate areas, mainly for beef production.
Originally from Herefordshire, England, they are found in the temperate parts of Australia. The breed also enjoys great popularity among ranchers in the desert American Southwest of the United States, as well as in the centre and east of Argentina and in Uruguay. Herefords made up the largest percentage of registered cows among herders in New Zealand. This is a testament to the hardiness of the breed; while originating in cool, moist Britain, they have thrived in much harsher climates. The breed has adapted to a wide range of climates on nearly every continent.
Hornless variants with the polled gene are known as the Polled Herefords. Breeding horned and hornless together functions as a genetic dehorner. This is often used as an alternative to a dehorning process, which causes stress and often weight loss.

Seafloor spreading is a type of geographic movement that happens on the bottom of an ocean. It happens at ridges in the middle of oceans where new oceanic crust is created. This crust is created by volcanic activity. The new crust then slowly moves away from the ridge. Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics.
Earlier theories (e.g., by Alfred Wegener) of continental drift were that continents "plowed" through the ocean. The idea that the ocean floor itself moves and carries the continents with it as it expands from a central axis was created by Harry Hess from Princeton University in the 1960s. Today, many people believe this theory is true. The phenomenon is known to be caused by convection currents in the very weak upper mantle, or asthenosphere.

An Artificial sweetener or Sugar substitute is a chemical. It is added to some foods to make them taste sweet. It is made to taste like sugar or corn syrup. Usually it has a much lower energy value than sugar. It can be found in many products which say "Light" or "Diet" in their name.

Studies done with animals have shown that artificial sweeteners cause weight gain. A sweet taste causes insulin to be produced. This will store some of the sugar in the blood in tissues, including fat. With artificial sweeteners, the amount of sugar in the blood does not increase. This means that there will be too little sugar in the blood. This is known as hypoglycemia. On the next meal, more food will be eaten to get the blood sugar level back to normal values.
After a while, rats given sweeteners have steadily increased the amount of calories. This increased body weight, and adiposity (fatness). The natural repsonse to easting sugary foods is to eat less at the next meal and to use some of the extra energy to warm the body after the meal. When using artifical sweeteners, this effect is lost gradually.

A microwave is a kind of high-frequency radio wave. It is often used to cook food in a microwave oven.
We can see waves travelling through water. There are many sorts of these waves, such as ripples, swell, tsunamis, and even sound waves that we do not see, but we hear if our ears are under the water.
Likewise, many different types of waves can travel through the air. We detect one type with our eyes as colours; we detect another type when it lands on our skin, as warmth; another type is called X-rays. Other types of these invisible waves are called microwaves.
We cannot see them. They can quickly penetrate quite deep into materials that contain water, for example most food. The energy in these waves makes the water molecules vibrate faster, which means the water gets hotter.
Although they can also heat some metals, there are materials, including many plastics, which they pass right through, without heating at all. Although many plastics used in bowls or cups will melt and get super-heated in microwave ovens.

Renewable energy commercialization in the United States
The current status of renewable energy commercialization in the United States varies considerably between different renewable energy technologies, with some being commercialized at the present time.
Wind power is a growing industry in the United States. Latest American Wind Energy Association figures show that installed U.S. wind power capacity now exceeds 11,600 MW which is enough to serve three million average households. Texas is firmly established as the leader in wind power development, followed by California.
Several solar thermal power stations, including the new 64 MW Nevada Solar One, have also been built. The largest of these solar thermal power stations is the SEGS group of plants in the Mojave Desert with a total generating capacity of 354 MW, making the system the largest solar plant of any kind in the world. The largest solar photovoltaic plant in the U.S. is the 4.6 MW Springerville Generating Station, located near Tucson, Arizona.
In terms of renewable fuels for transportation, most cars on the road today in the U.S. can run on blends of up to 10% ethanol fuel, and motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends.

Linear algebra describes ways to solve and manipulate (rearrange) systems of linear equations.
These two equations form a system of linear equations.
It is linear because none of the variables are raised to a power.
Often the graph of a linear equation is a straight line.
since it makes all of the original equations valid, that is, the value on left side of the equals sign is exactly the same as the value on the right side for both equations.
Linear algebra uses a system of notation for describing system behavior, called a matrix.
For the previous example, the coefficients of the equations can be stored in a coefficient matrix.

A seed is the part of a plant that the plant makes that can grow into a new plant, by planting near another plant. There are many different kinds of seeds. Some plants make a lot of seeds, some make only a few. Seeds are often hard and very small, but some are larger. The coconut is a seed which can be as big as a child's head. A seed needs water, air and warmth but not sunlight to germinate (become a seedling).
Because most kinds of seeds carry the food that helps the new plant begin to grow, many kinds of seeds are good food for animals and people. Seeds are often inside fruits. The many kinds of grain that people grow, such as rice, wheat, and maize, are all seeds.
The seed also has a seed coat. The seed coat is an outer covering that protects the seed.

A great circle the largest possible circle that can be drawn on a sphere, one that divides the surface into equal halves, called hemispheres. It is a circle that has the same diameter as the sphere it was drawn on. These curves are geodesics in the sphere and all have the same circumference, that is, the length of the circle.
There are an infinite number of great circles that can be drawn on any perfect sphere. The latitude lines on a globe all form great circles that pass through the same two points (the North Pole and the South Pole). The Equator is another great circle.
Great Circles can be used to determine the shortest surface distance between two points on a sphere (or on the earth).
A straight line from plane Euclidean geometry corresponds to a Great Circle in non-Euclidean spherical geometry.

A logical disk is a concept from computing. Logical disks provide a certain amount of space to store data. Unlike real (called "physical") hard disks that can be touched, logical disks can take this storage space from different locations.
The disk is described as "logical" because it does not actually exist as a single physical entity in its own right.
Why do we need them?
When IBM first released the magnetic disk drive in the 1956 (IBM 305) a single drive would be directly attached to the using system, with each disk managed as a single entity. As the development of drives continued, it became apparent that reliability was a problem and systems using RAID technology evolved. This means that more than one physical disks are "RAID-ed" together to produce a single logical disk.
In a modern home PC environment, disk drives now provide hundreds of gigabytes of storage capacity which can be impractical to use as a single entity. Therefore most systems have their drives partitioned into multiple "logical drives".
In most modern business IT environments, some form of a Storage area network will exist. Here, many storage devices are connected to many host server devices in a network. A single RAID array may provide some capacity to one server, and some capacity to another. Therefore logical disks are used to partition the available capacity and provide the amount of storage needed by each host from a common pool of logical disks.

Edwards v. Aguillard was a 1987 United States Supreme Court case that said that creationism (see that article) was not science, as its fans said it was. The Supreme Court said that it was religion, and could not be taught in American schools, because the United States Constitution (the set of rules that all American government must follow) does not allow the government to support one religion more than other religions, and so schools run by the government cannot teach religion as being true. This rule is known as the Establishment Clause.

Rye is a type of grass, usually grown as a grain or forage crop (meaning that it is fed to animals). It is a member of the wheat family of plants and is similar to wheat and barley. It is used to make flour, food for animals, and many types of alcoholic drinks.

Rye has not always been a plant humans can use. It was originally a wild plant. There are several wild plants in Turkey that are similar to rye.
Since the Middle Ages, rye has been used widely in Central and Eastern Europe. In these parts of the world, it is still one of the main ingredients in making bread. However, the number of people and businesses using rye is becoming lower. Rye is usually sold to buyers near to where it is grown.

Rye can be planted to feed animals or can be harvested for hay (dry grass). Rye is a strong plant that can survive in soil with a high or low pH. This means it can survive even if the soil is very acidic or alkaline. Other plants may struggle to survive in these pH levels.

Unlike most lizards, geckos have voices. A gecko sounds a little like a bird or a frog. In some languages these lizards have names that sound like their calls, for example, both English and Indonesian call one kind gecko (gek KO) and tokay (to-KAY). Another kind of gecko, with a different sound, is called chicak (CHEE chak).
Geckos have no eyelids. Instead, they have a clear membrane (skin) over their eyes. They lick the membrane clean with their tongues.
Many kinds of geckos can walk on walls, windows and ceilings. They can do this because they have special toe pads. A microscope can show that each toe pad is made of thousands of hair-like structures. Each of these structures branches into many smaller ends.

A zygote is the fertilized cell that will grow into a baby animal. When a female's ovum and a male's sperm cell become one, this cell is called the "zygote". The zygote then multiplies, and grows into an embryo.
Some animals keep the zygote in their bodies until it is a full-grown baby. The time between the forming of the zygote and the baby's birth is called pregnancy. Other animals do not keep the zygote in their bodies, but lay an egg. The zygote grows inside the egg until it is ready and the baby animal "hatches".

Gadolinium is a chemical element. It has the chemical symbol Gd. It has the atomic number 64. It is part of a group of chemical elements in the periodic table named the Lanthanides. It is a rare earth element. It is silvery white, malleable and ductile.
Its main uses are as chemical compounds in color televisions and nuclear magnetic resonance radio contrast agents. In color cathode ray tube televisions (the type first produced, not flat televisions) some of the pixels are dots gadolinium compounds. When the electrons from the cathode ray tube hit the pixels and transfer energy to the gadolinium compounds they give out light as energy. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging is used in medicine where it is named MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging). It is used to take picture of inside the body. How the pictures look is changed by the gadolinium compounds and how much water is around. It makes the images clearer because it makes the difference in the concentration of water in different parts of the body look more clear (more contrast) in the picture that is made.

The system of Hebrew numerals is a quasi-decimal alphabetic numeral system using the letters of the Hebrew alphabet.
In this system, zero does not have a place, and the number values for each letter is added together. Each unit (1, 2..., 9) is assigned a separate letter, each tens (10, 20..., 90) a separate letter, and each hundreds (100, 200..., 900) a separate letter.

Hebrew has masculine and feminine ways of saying the words. For just counting, feminine is used. Otherwise, the gender is used (ex. two boys, two girls).

Constipation is when it is very hard to get rid of digested food waste (feces). Constipation can be caused by many things. One is eating or drinking too much dairy products that use cow milk. To solve this problem many people use a laxative. Another possible cause could be an obstruction somewhere along the digestive tract (the path that food travels inside the body).
When a person is constipated their lower stomach and intestinal area will be blocked. People can usually conquer constipation by eating natural laxatives such a fruits, fruit juice and dietary supplements.

A marker is a writing device that allows a person to draw, write, or scribble. Ink comes out of the tip of the marker and onto the writing surface, commonly a piece of paper. Markers generally come in a variety of different colors. They are sometimes referred to as "magic markers", or magic pens. Markers that have ink that will stay there forever are called permanent markers. There are whiteboard markers which are used on the whiteboard. These markers' ink can be cleared away with dusters.
The tip of the marker where ink comes out from is usually made of cloth. This allows the ink to go through easily. A lot of ink can come out from it at one time.

A Tarantella is a very fast dance in 6/8 time. The name comes from the town of Taranto in Italy. People used to believe that if someone was bitten by a tarantula spider they needed to do this dance in order to drive out the poison. The dancer would get more and more excited until he (or she) seemed mad.
Some people think that maybe these people never really believed this, but that it was an excuse to dance at a time when the church said that dancing was not allowed. The spider is, in fact, only a little bit poisonous.
Some composers enjoyed writing fast pieces in 6/8 time which they called "Tarantella". Mendelssohn wrote one as the last movement of his Symphony no 4 (the Italian). Chopin and Liszt also wrote Tarantellas.

Docetism is an early Christian teaching that says that Jesus only appeared to have a human body. The term comes from "dokein": "to seem".
Early Christians believed all matter was unclean. For this reason, Christ could not have a physical body, as he was seen as the eternal Logos.
Today, it is unclear where this teaching came from. It might have been influenced by the teachings of Plato. Platon taught that only ideas mattered and that matter itself was inferior.
Many Gnostic teachings are docetic. For a long time, people belived that docetism and Gnosticism were developed together. This is however not the case, there are also some Gnost systems that are not docetic, as well as some docetic systems that are not gnostic.
Today, most Christian theolgians see docetism as a heresy.

Distributed computing is a word from computer science, about using many computers to solve a big problem. One way to solve a big problem is to use a very fast computer called a supercomputer. Supercomputers are very expensive, and many scientists can't buy them. A cheaper way to solve a big problem is to split it into smaller problems, when possible. These smaller problems can then be solved by different computers (or processors), which talk to each other over a computer network. Because many computers work together, this makes them as powerful as a supercomputer. One example where distributed computing is used is the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search.

Epilepsy is a common chronic neurological condition that is characterised by unprovoked seizures. People with epilepsy are sometimes wrongly called "epileptic". This is wrong because it is the fit or seizure that is "epileptic".
In most cases, epilepsy is caused by scars in the brain. Some forms of the condition are caused by genes, they may be passed on from the parents to the children. Very often, the actual cause for an epileptic seizure is lack of sleep, too much alcohol, or other things that cause stress.
Many countries in the world say there are special rules for people who have epilepsy. They need to be without a seizure for some time before they may drive a car. They also need to take drugs to treat their illness. In many countries, such people may not drive autobuses, taxis or lorries.

"General Hospital" (commonly abbreviated "GH") is the longest-running ABC Daytime American soap opera broadcast on the American Broadcasting Company television network. It is also the longest-running serial produced in Hollywood (having been taped at the Prospect Avenue ABC Television Center West and Sunset-Gower Studios).
Set in the fictional city of Port Charles, New York, General Hospital debuted on April 1, 1963, the same day that rival network NBC launched its own medical daytime drama, The Doctors. The show originally aired for a half-hour until the network expanded it to the unusual length of 45 minutes in 1976, and then to a full hour in 1978. The serial was created by soap writers Frank and Doris Hursley, a husband-and-wife team.
General Hospital is credited for starting several trends in the soap opera genre in the 1980s, most notably that of the fast-paced action-adventure plotlines that were remarkably different from the more traditional domestic and social issues that had been the sole focus of most soap operas during the previous decades. In 2003, when GH was celebrating its 40th anniversary, TV Guide named it "The Greatest Soap Opera Of All Time." In addition, GH was also named as one of TIME Magazine's "Top 100 Television Shows of All Time."

An apostrophe is a form of punctuation used in writing. The following words have an apostrophe in them: can't, it's, Mike's.
This is a wrong use of an apostrophe: Those dog's are big.
Apostrophes are used to show that some letters have been taken out in an abbreviation.
Apostropes are also used to show something belongs to someone (or something).
But the word 'its', meaning 'something belonging to it', does "not" have an apostrophe.
This is also the same with "your," "their," and "our."
for example: That's not mine, it's yours. That's not ours, it's theirs.
You should not put an apostrophe in the middle of a word ending in s, such as a plural. Put an apostrophe, or 's, at the end of the word instead.
"Go get 'em tiger!" or "Li'l Bow Bow"

A headset is a headphone with a microphone. People can listen to sound with headphone and can record sound with a microphone. A headset is easy to use because it can be used without hands, just like a telephone. A person only needs to put the headset on his/her head and then can talk with a mic. Many people use headsets at the computer so they can converse and type easily. Headsets normally have only one speaker like a telephone, but also can be made with speakers for both ears.

Nowadays there are wire headset and wireless headset, which means there's no line between the computer and the headset. A wireless headset can be put in a pocket or a bag easily due to its small size. This can be used for soundproofing in a game show or quiz show.

The inventor of the headset is Nathaniel Baldwin, but his version couldn't be sold to people.
The second headset is the US Army's headset for airplane pilots in World War I.
How headsets work?
Headset is made up of two parts. They are input part and output part. From input part, headset receive sound signal. And from output part, headset receive sound signal and generate sound.

A fuel is a substance that is changed in some way to produce heat, electricity, or other forms of energy. This is usually by being burnt, although there are exceptions, such as nuclear fuel. Fuel can be divided into two main types: fossil fuels and other fuels.

Some people do not want us to use fossil fuels because they may pollute the environment. Because all fossil fuels are made out of carbon, burning them makes carbon dioxide. Some people think that too much carbon dioxide in the air may cause a greenhouse effect. Fossil fuels are also non-renewable, or renew extremely slowly (thousands of years). This means that we will eventually run out of fossil fuels.

These fuels are renewable. This means that we can make more of them if we run out. For instance, if we run out of ethanol, we can grow some more corn and make some more ethanol.

Social Darwinism is a term used for different movements. Charles Darwin was one of the main discoverers of evolution. Evolution is a concept from biology that tries to explain how different life-forms change over time. It basically says that because most children are not exactly like their parents, there is change. Some of the children will have features (or traits). These features will mean that some children are better adapted to the place where they live. They will therefore be better able to have offspring. Some of the offspring might also have the trait of their parents.
Social Darwinism theories try to use these ideas from biology for human society. They talk about a "Struggle for survival" of human societies. During the era of Nazi ideologies, the idea of Survival of the fittest combined with racism. Since the Aryan race was better than all the other races, it needed more space to live. This space was to be provided in the east (where mostly Slavs lived).
Today, this is mostly seen as badly named. Most of the ideas for the theories are from Lamarckism and not from the theory of evolution, proposed by Charles Darwin.

Random access memory (or simply RAM) is the memory or information storage in a computer that is used to store running programs and data for the programs. Data (information) in the RAM can be read and written quickly in any order. Normally, the random access memory is in the form of computer chips. Usually, the contents of RAM are accessible faster than other types of information storage but are lost every time the computer is turned off.

Information that the computer always needs, that does not often change, is normally kept in read-only memory (ROM), which does not lose its contents when the computer is turned off. Such items include the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System), which stores the most basic commands for the computer, telling it how it should start up. The BIOS can be compared to the part of your brain that tells your heart how to beat.

An example (Latin "exemplum", the shorthand "e.g". stands for "exempli gratia", which means "for example") is a short story, or an anecdote. This story is told to illustrate something else, like an idea or a concept.
In the Middle Ages, preachers and priests used examples in their sermons. They did this to explain things from the bible. They also did this to explain to all those people (that were incapable of reading) how they should lead their lives, as a good person.
The phrase "make an example" is sometimes used, when a person is harshly punished for others to see. This is done to keep other people (especially the person's peers) from doing the same thing that got that person into trouble.

A rip current is a strong surface flow of water returning seaward from near the shore (not to be confused with an undertow). It is often mistakenly called a "rip tide" or "riptide", though the occurrence is not related to the tides. Colloquially a rip current is known simply as a rip. Although rip currents would exist even without the tides, tides can make an existing rip much more dangerous (especially low tide). Typical flow is at 0.5 meters per second (1-2 feet per second), and can be as fast as 2.5 meters per second (8 feet per second). Rip currents can move to different locations on a beach break, up to tens of metres (a few hundred feet) a day. They can happen at any beach with breaking waves, including the world's oceans, seas, and large lakes such as the Great Lakes in Canada and the United States.

The Mackinac Bridge is a 5-mile-long (8-km.-long) bridge that carries a four-lane interstate highway, Interstate 75. It was built by the U.S. state of Michigan and connects that state's Upper Peninsula and Lower Peninsula together.
The Mackinac Bridge passes over a strait of water that connects two Great Lakes, Lake Michigan (to the west of the bridge) and Lake Huron (to the east).
At the center of the Mackinac Bridge is a long suspension span, in which the bridge, made of steel and concrete, hangs from wires that run down from two huge, curved cables.
The government agency that runs the Mackinac Bridge charges motor vehicles a toll to drive over it. In 2007, the toll was $2.50 for a passenger car.
The government hangs colored lights from the big cable, and turns them on at night so that the bridge can be seen from many miles away.
The Mackinac Bridge was opened in 1957, and this started a major economic boom in northern Michigan as tourists drove from all over North America to see the bridge, the Great Lakes, and the northern forests.

First aid is basic knowledge about injuries (body damage). It is used at accidents to help stop more serious harm from happening to an injured person until he receives medical treatment (help by doctors, nurses or ambulance paramedics). A person does not need a lot of equipment to give first aid. Because of this, it can be done just about anywhere.

You need very good training to give first aid. Training is given by a very experienced (lots of knowledge) medical person, for example a doctor or a nurse. The level of training needed to be a first aid giver changes from country to country - for example, in the UK you can go on a 1-day course to become a first aid giver for anything, and a 4-day course for emergencies in a place of work.

Euler's Identity
Euler's Identity, sometimes called Euler's Equation, is a simple equation that links several important numbers in mathematics in an unexpected way. Euler's identity is named after the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler.
Euler's identity is the equation formula_1.
The special numbers in Euler's Identity, are

A reader poll done by Physics World in 2004 called Euler's identity the "greatest equation ever", together with Maxwell's equations. Richard Feynman called Euler's identity "the most beautiful equation". The Identity is well-known for its mathematical beauty; that is, the equation is very pretty and pleasing to the eye. Some say this is because it is simple, and others because it uses many basic mathematical elements.
Mathematical Proof using Euler's Formula.
Euler's Formula is the equation formula_11. Our variable formula_12 can be any real number, but for this proof formula_13. Then formula_14. Since formula_15 and formula_16, the equation can be changed to read formula_17, which gives the identity formula_1.

Juan Evo Morales Aima (born October 26, 1959) is the President of Bolivia. He is an Aymara Native American, and is politically a leftist. He is the founder and leader of the Movement toward Socialism (or MAS) political party. "Movimiento al Socialismo" is its Spanish name. On January 22, 2006, he became President of Bolivia. His party has declared that he is the first indigenous person to be president of Bolivia. Not everyone believes this to be true because of his mestizo heritage and similar backgrounds of several past Bolivian presidents. Nonetheless, he is likely the first "culturally" indigenous president of Bolivia.

The Hanging Gardens of Babylon (also called the Hanging Gardens of Semiramis) and the walls of Babylon (near present-day Al Hillah in Iraq) are one of the Seven Wonders of the World. They were built by Nebuchadnezzar II around 600 BC. He is told to have built the gardens to please his wife, Amytis of Media. She wanted to see the trees and plants of her homeland. The hanging gardens were destroyed in an earthquake after the 1st century BC.

Some people do not believe the Hanging Gardens were real. In ancient writings the Hanging Gardens of Babylon were first described by Berossus, a Chaldean priest. He lived in the late 4th century B.C. Greek historians later wrote more about them.
Recent archaeological digs of the palace in Iraq have uncovered evidence of a building with vaults and a well nearby. However, the place of the palace complex is different from where Greek historians said they were, which was on the banks of the Euphrates River.
However, recently there have been digs on the banks of the Euphrates River of some large 25 meter-thick walls.

A joint (articulation) is the place at which two bones make contact (articulate). Joints allow movement and give mechanical support.
Joints have cartilage in between to make the movement flexible.Joints are mainly classified structurally and functionally. Structural classification is determined by how the bones connect to each other, while functional classification is determined by the degree of movement between the articulating bones. In practice, there is significant overlap between the two types of classifications.

Language families are groups of languages that are related to each other because they come from a common older language. The languages in such a family are similar in their vocabulary or structure.
For example, French and Spanish both come from Latin. Latin was spoken a long time ago, and some of the people who spoke it started to speak one way, saying, for example, for good: "bueno" while another group started saying "bon." Most words are said a little differently in Spanish and French, so the two are called different languages.
Most languages belong to a language family, but some languages do not. These languages are called Language isolates.
There also are Constructed languages, like for example Esperanto. Constructed languages are made for different reasons: making a 'world language', for fun, for use in fiction, etc.

The Twelve Olympians are the most important gods of Greek mythology, who lived on top of Mount Olympus. Seventeen gods have been said to have been Olympians, but there were never more than twelve at the same time.
Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Ares, Hermes, Hephaestus, Aphrodite, Athena, Apollo, and Artemis are always considered to be Olympians. Hebe, Helios, Hestia, Demeter, Dionysus, Hades, and Persephone are the gods who have sometimes been Olympians. Hestia gave up her place to Dionysus because she wanted to live amongst humans.
The Olympians became the most important gods when Zeus and his brothers and sisters won a war against the Titans. Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Demeter, Hestia, and Hades are all brothers and sisters. All the other gods are Zeus's children and have different mothers.

Potassium is a chemical element in the periodic table. It has the symbol K. This is from the Latin word "kalium". Potassium's atomic number is 19. Its melting point is 63 degrees celsius. It is an alkali metal. It acts in many chemical reactions like sodium. It is a very soft metal that can be cut. Potassium is a silvery white metal that tarnishes in air and produces an oxidized layer on the surface, which is why it is stored in oil.
The word potassium comes from the word "potash". Potash is a chemical that has been used for a very long time. It is used to make fertilizer, soap, and glass.
Potassium is very important to organisms. It helps the body send messages from cells to other cells. It helps biological membranes "depolarize". This means go from a negative to a positive electrical charge. This is needed for muscles to "contract" (get shorter and move things.) It is needed for the heart to "beat" (push blood through blood vessels.) If the potassium level in the blood is too high or too low it can cause death because the heart stops. A good source of potassium is bananas.

Rugby sevens is the shortened version of rugby union in which only seven players per side feature, instead of the full fifteen. The version of rugby union is very popular, with notable competitions including the IRB Sevens World Series and the Rugby World Cup Sevens.It is also played at events such as the Commonwealth Games and rugby league has also adopted the sevens format.
It is played under the same rules and on a field of the same dimensions as the 15-player game but a rugby sevens match lasts approximately 15 minutes (7 minutes aside with 1 minute half-time break) but the finals last somewhat more than 20 minutes; each half in a final is ten minutes instead of the normal seven minutes and the point system is similar to rugby union where a Try gets a team 5 points and conversion 2 points with 3 points for penalties and Drop-goals (drop-goals are very uncommon in sevens)). Points scoring occurs with much greater regularity in sevens compared to fifteens, since there are more spaces for players to run. Scrums still exist within sevens, composed of just three players from each team. Given the speedy nature of the game, players are usually either from the backline or the trio of loose forwards in fifteens rugby.

Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania () is one of the 16 States of Germany. The capital is Schwerin.

All have a population of less than 200,000. Schwerin, the state capital, is the smallest state capital in Germany. Usually Schwerin would not be called a city. In Germany a city has over 100000 people.

Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania was going to change the borders of all of its urban districts (towns) and rural districts (kreise or "counties". The state supreme court stopped the changes.

Capital has a number of related meanings in economics, finance and accounting.
In finance and accounting, capital generally refers to financial wealth, especially that used to start or maintain a business.
The third part of the definition was not always used by classical economists. The classical economist David Ricardo would use the above definition for the term fixed capital while including raw materials and intermediate products are part of his circulating capital. For him, both were kinds of capital.

An album is a collection of sound recordings. It is usually made by a musician, and is sold in stores to people. Albums today come in the form of compact discs. Some musicians make albums on vinyl records that can be played on record players.

There are two main types of albums, studio albums and live albums. Studio albums are recorded at a recording studio. Live albums are normally recorded while the musicians are performing for an audience. Live albums are usually recorded at concerts.
Tracks== .
Albums are normally separated into "Tracks". Each track is a part of the album which has one song in it. The term is often used to mean a specific song on the album by number. For example, the "forth track" or "track four" from an album is the forth song on the album when it is played from the beginning.

The Gospel of Luke is a book of the Bible. Like the other gospels, the "Gospel of Luke" tells the stories of the life and teachings of Jesus. It is the third book of the New Testament and comes after the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Mark. The gospel is believed to be written by Luke, who was a friend of the Apostle Paul.
Luke was a doctor. He wrote his gospel for a man called Theophilus. Luke wrote another book which is fifth in the New Testament, the Acts of the Apostles which tells what Jesus's disciples did after his ascension.
Unlike the gospel writers Matthew, Mark and John, Luke was probably not Jewish but was Greek. He wrote the gospel mainly for non-Jewish people, (who were called Gentile by the Jews). Luke wrote to prove that Jesus is the Son of God. Luke's gospel contains many similar stories of Jesus. He tells more about the birth of Jesus than the other gospel writers.

Deflation means that generally the prices of products are going down. It is the opposite of inflation. It is said, that deflation happens when there is less money than there are goods (goods are almost any kind of product). It is also said that deflation is a sign of a weak state of that country's economy, because deflation usually happens during an economic collapse. Deflation is thought to be even worse than inflation.
Deflation starts when people are waiting for prices to go down even more. They will then spend less money. Because of that, companies can't afford to keep up the amount of goods that are made, and have to lower that amount, as well as fire workers to make even a small profit.
Even if an economy is growing, there can be some amount of deflation - if the amount of money going around grows slower than the making of goods. There hasn't been much deflation in the world after 1930s, except for one in Japan in the 1990s.
Deflation can be helped by the country's own government by lowering the companies' tax levels, so they can lower their prices while getting the same profit. This way normal people are more encouraged to buy the cheap goods they were waiting for, and slowly the companies can make more profit. Governments don't like deflation, because it means that they can collect less tax.

Atlas is a Titan in Greek mythology. He is the son of Iapetos. He has seven daughter with the Oceanid Pleione. They are called the Pleiades.
After the war between the Titans and the Olympians, Atlas was punished. Zeus forced him to hold the heaven on the western edge of the world. Later, the story about him changed and it was said that he held the whole world on his shoulders. Mostly in modern times, he is shown holding a globe of the world.
Heracles came to Atlas and asked him to for help with one of his Labours. He wanted Atls to get the "Golden Apples" for him. Atlas agreed, but only if Heracles would hold up the sky. Atlas was pleased to be free from its weigh but Heracles tricked him into holding it again.
Perseus also came to Altlas for help after killing the Medusa. He asked for food, and Atlas said he could not help. Perseus was angry and showed him the Medusa's head (which was able to turn people to stone). Atlas then became the Atlas Mountains.

The Khmer Rouge (Kmae Krahaam) in romanized Khmer, French language for Red Khmer, were a Stalinist, Maoist-extremist group which took over the capital of Kampuchea, Phnom Penh, on April 17, 1975. It was led by Pol Pot, who was called Saloth Sar before the take over. They named the country Democratic Kampuchea. They immediately forced everyone out of the cities, effectively turning the whole country into a giant labor camp. They were defeated by the Vietnamese in January of 1979. During the Khmer Rouge Years, between 1.7 million and 3 million people were killed (20% - 35% of the population) in a genocide comparable to the Holocaust. The international community continued to recognize the Khmer Rouge as the government of Kampuchea for a decade after they were defeated. Therefore the Khmer Rouge held a seat in the UN until 1989.

"Tetris" is a video game where the goal is to drop blocks, called tetriminoes, down into a playing field to make lines. Tetriminoes are made of four connected squares each, and there are seven different shapes of tetriminoes. A player uses the tetrominoes to make unbroken lines of squares across the bin from left to right by stacking them in the playing field. When a player makes a line, it clears. After a clear, squares over that line fall. As play goes on, the tetrominoes fall faster. A player loses when the tetrominoes make it to the top of the playing field.
Tetris has appeared in many video game systems. It has become very common from back when Alexey Pazhitnov first made it in 1985.

Gills are what fish, amphibians, and some other animals use to breathe in water. They have feathery parts that water moves across in the animal's body, which contains dissolved oxygen, after the animal has swallowed the water. The oxygen is absorbed into the animal's blood. When this happens, carbon dioxide moves out of the animal's blood and into the water through the gills.
Fish and frog gills are hidden on the sides of their heads. Sharks have many gills slits on their necks. Baby salamanders have gills that stick out like leaves from their heads.
In mushrooms, gills are the spore-bearing structure in agarics (gilled mushrooms).

Birth defect is the name people use to say that when a baby is born, there are some things, that are wrong with it. Birth defects are usually congenital; it means they are with the child from birth. However, only some of these defects are visible at birth. Some birth defects are with the child for many years before they get visible.
Some birth defects are more serious than others. Birthmarks are birth defects, as well. Some kinds are quite common. Most kinds pose little health risks.

About 3 percent of all babies have what is called a "major physical anomaly". This is something that either impacts the way certain things look, or how they work.
Birth defects involving the brain are the most common problems. They concern about 10 per 1000 live births, compared to heart problems, at 8 per 1000, kidney problems at 4 per 1000, and limbs at 1 per 1000. All other physical anomalies together occur in 6 per 1000 live births.
Birth defects of the heart have the highest risk of death during childhood. They are the cause of 28% of infant deaths due to birth defects, while chromosomal abnormalities and respiratory abnormalities each account for 15%, and brain malformations about 12%. About 10% of deaths in children are because of a genetic disease. This is more than the number of deaths caused by infectious diseases.
China Birth Deformity Monitoring Centre says that one baby with birth defects is born every 30 seconds in China.

Bernoulli's principle
Bernoulli's principle in a concept in fluid dynamics. It says that when an incompressible fluid moves through different sizes of tube, the fluid's speed changes. This change in velocity is called "acceleration". Newton showed that acceleration only occurs through the action of a force. When a force acts over an area, it is called "pressure". So any change in a fluid's speed must be matched by a change in pressure (force). Bernoulli saw that the speed of the flow went up in the smaller part of the tube while the pressure on the side of the tube went down.
The full version of Bernoulli's principle includes both the work performed by the pressure and by the changes in potential energy from changes in height. In this form, the principle says the sum of the pressure, kinetic energy, and potential energy is a constant. (Bernoulli does not take into account viscosity or compressibility.)

Cartilage is the hard substance that the body uses to connect bones together. It also allows joints to move smoothly and protects against shocks to the body. It is found in the joints, the rib cage, the ear, the nose, the throat and between the bones of the back. The main purpose of cartilage is to create a place on which bones can form when they are first created. It also protects the places where bones rub against each other.

Cartilage has cells and fibres (tiny strings) that cross over each other like fabric.

A Coelacanth is a fish that lives in the Indian Ocean. Coelacanths are very rare. Coelacanths are also found as fossils as old as some dinosaurs.

The Coelacanth is the only living example of the fossil Coelacanth fishes. They are also the closest link between fish and the first amphibian creatures which made the transition from sea to land in the Devonian period (408-362 Million Years Ago). That such a creature could have existed for so long is nearly incredible, but some say that the cold depths of the West Indian ocean at which the Coelacanth thrives, and the small number of predators it has, may have helped the species survive eons of change.

The Coelacanth was first discovered in 1938 by Marjorie Courtenay Latimer, the curator of a small museum in the port town of East London, as she was visiting a fisherman who would let her search through his boat's catch for interesting specimens.

A pet is a domesticated animal that lives with people, but is not forced to work and is not eaten, in most instances. In most cases, a pet is kept to entertain people or for companionship.
Dogs, cats, fish, birds are the most common pets in North America. Horses, elephants, oxen, and donkeys are usually made to work, so they are not usually called pets. Some dogs also do work for people, and it was once common for some birds (like falcons and carrier pigeons) to work for humans.
The cap'tchi tribe in Sudan is known for the ritual burning of domesticated animals that are considered too sacred to eat.

Sir Arthur Sullivan (b.Lambeth, London, May 13 1842; d.London, November 22 1900) was an English composer. In his lifetime people thought he was the best British composer, but nowadays his serious works are rarely heard. He worked with an author and poet called W. S. Gilbert, and together they wrote fourteen comic operas. Their names are always mentioned together: "Gilbert and Sullivan". Their operas were very popular a hundred years ago, and most still are. The most popular are "The Mikado", "H.M.S. Pinafore" and "The Pirates of Penzance". The two men were very different. They argued sometimes, but they worked together for 25 years, from 1871 to 1896.
Sullivan's serious works include one grand opera, two dozen orchestral and choral pieces, and many hymns and songs, including "Onward Christian Soldiers" and "The Lost Chord".

Puce is a deep rose or brownish-purple colour. Chinese dried plums can also be said to be puce coloured.
The name is from the French word "puce" which means "flea". Some poeple say that the colour name comes from the colour of a squashed flea or the colour of a flea full of blood. Other people say that colour name comes from the flea's droppings of digested blood, which spread out in deep red stain when water contacts them.
On the other hand, the colour name may refer to blue-lavender of the Pennyroyal flower, also named "puce" in French. The name comes from the use of strong-smelling Pennyroyal to ward off fleas.

Hurricane Luis was one of the most powerful storms of the very active 1995 Atlantic hurricane season. Hurricane Luis was the strongest storm to hit the Leeward Islands since Hurricane Hugo in 1989. Luis was one of the four tropical cyclones active from August 22 to September 1 along with Humberto, Iris, Jerry, and Karen.

Hurricane Luis formed on August 27 near Cape Verde as Tropical Depression Thirteen. It reached Tropical Storm status on the 29th. It reached hurricane status on August 30 and reach category 4 strength on September 2. The next day Luis reached it highest winds.

The name Luis was retired in the spring of 1996 and will never be used for another Atlantic hurricane. It was replaced with Lorenzo in the 2001 season.

A tragedy is a sad thing. In theatre, a tragedy is a play that ends sadly. A tragedy is usually about a person who has many good qualities, but has one bad quality (called a "tragic flaw") that causes trouble for him, and may cause him, or his family or friends, to be in trouble.
Often in a tragedy, there is one thing that the hero does not want to happen and tries to prevent, but no matter what he does, it makes this thing more and more sure to happen. They originated in Ancient Greece where they were performed at religious festivals. The three most famous Greek tragedy writers were Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides.

This is a list of the gods and goddesses of Greek mythology. Roman Mythology uses different names, calling Zeus by the name of Jupiter, and Aphrodite by the name of Venus, for example. The Roman names are often better known to English-speaking people than the Greek names.
It was thought that each god ruled a certain part of the environment and human life. The primordial gods mostly controlled the natural environment. The twelve Olympian gods, as well as controlling nature, ruled over many aspects of human life, including love, marriage, war etc. In the stories of Greek mythology, the gods often argued among themselves, and played favorites with human beings. They would make things go well for a human, (particularly a hero), that they liked, but could make things go very badly for another god's favorite. They sometimes had love affairs with human beings, and when children were born, they often had special powers. The most famous of all "demi-gods" was Heracles (or Hercules) who was the son of Zeus and a human woman.

See also "Titan (mythology)".

These gods are the most important and powerful gods. The home of these gods was Mount Olympus.

The flag of Poland is rectangular, divided into two stripes: white above red. It was created in its modern form in 1921. The colors white and red were earlier declared the official national colors in 1831 by the Polish Parliament in 1831.
For many centuries the Polish flag was a white eagle on a red background.

The ratio of height to width is 5 to 8. The two horizontal stripes are of equal height.
There is a second version which has a coat of arms in the upper (white) half. The use of this flag is legally restricted.
If the flag is shown hanging vertically, the white should be on the left.

The exact color of the red was not clearly stated originally, and has changed through the years. In 1919 the official act did not clearly define the red. In 1921 the Polish Ministry of Military Affairs used crimson as the shade of red in publications. In 1928 the president of Poland said the red should be vermilion. That was used until 1980, when people needed to specify the red more scientifically.

The same flag design is used in the German region Thuringia and the Spanish region Cantabria.
Both Indonesia and Monaco have flags that are the same colors, but upside-down.

Ovaries (Singular: Ovary) are organs found in female organisms. Ovaries are part of the reproductive system needed to reproduce sexually.
Most vertebrates have ovaries. Usually animals have two ovaries. Birds usually have only one working ovary, snakes have one ovary in front of the other. The ovaries are similar to testicles in men.

Ovaries are shaped like eggs and are around 3 cm by 1.5 cm by 1.5 cm. The ovary is found in the side walls of the pelvis.
Each ovary is attached to the Fallopian tube. Usually each ovary takes turns releasing eggs every month.

During menstruation, a ovum is released from the ovary to be fertilised. Ovaries have a certain number of eggs in them, so when eggs stop being released, this is the start of the menopause. During this time, female hormones stop being produced.

The lift force, lifting force or simply lift is the sum of all the forces on a body that force him to move upwards (or to be exact for the case of "negative lift": vertical).
The most common type of lift is that of a wing of an aircraft. But there are many other common uses such as propellers on both aircraft and boats, rotors on helicopters, fan blades, sails on sailboats and even some kinds of wind turbines.
While the common meaning of the term "lift" suggests an "upwards" action, in fact, the direction of lift (and its definition) does not depend on the meaning of "up" and "down". Specifically, the term negative lift means the lift force directed "down".
There are a number of ways of explaining the production of lift, all of which are equivalent. That is, there are different expressions of the same underlying physical principles.

Cerulean is a range of colours from deep blue, sky-blue, bright blue or azure to greenish blue. The word cerulean comes from the Latin word "caeruleum", which means "sky" or "heavens". This was in turn from Latin "caeruleus" dark blue: resembling the blue of the sky.
In classical times, this term was used to describe blue pigments, particularly mixtures of copper and cobaltous oxides. These early attempts to create sky blue colours were often less than satisfactory due to greenish hues and lack of permanence. When the pigment cerulean blue was invented people started using this instead.

Chemistry [kem'-ihs-tree] is the science of "chemical elements" and "compounds", and how these things work together. It is the study of the materials (things) that make up our bodies and everything in the world around us.
Chemistry began as a true science during the 1600s. This is when chemists discovered the simplest substances that make up all other substances. These simple substances are called "elements". For a long time before that, people were trying to study these things to figure out how to do things like turn lead into gold, but no one ever did. This was called alchemy [al-kem-mee].
A chemical "compound" is a substance made up of two or more "elements".

Sexual abstinence is the practice of voluntarily refraining from some or all aspects of sexual activity. Common reasons to deliberately abstain from the physical expression of sexual desire include religious or philosophical reasons (e.g. chastity), material reasons (to prevent conception (undesired pregnancy) or Sexually Transmitted Disease transmission), or to conform to legal regulations.
Sexual abstinence has been debated since ancient history, both in terms of same-sex and opposite-sex relationships.

Many religious and ethical systems proscribe sexual activities between a person and anyone other than a spouse of that person, including most denominational variations of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, as have, historically, many legal systems and societal norms.

The Sahel is a narrow belt of land in West Africa. It is a strip of dry land about 5500 kilometres long and 450 kilometres wide. It lies at the southern edge of the Sahara Desert. It is located between the dry desert land to the north and the forest areas to the south. The Sahel has a tropical semi-arid climate. The temperature is high throughout the year. There is little rainfall in the Sahel (300mm-600mm), It is concentrated during summer months and can be unreliable. It may be very dry in some years, especially if a large area of low pressure, which brings rain, is not carried North over the Sahel by strong winds.
Sahel is the Arab word for 'edge' or 'shore'.

Insects have small holes in their bodies that allow them to breathe. These holes are called spiracles. Air comes in the spiracles and goes to trachea, or tubes. These tubes take the oxygen to other parts of the insect body. Because insects have no lungs, air comes in and goes out of the spiracles passively (by itself). Some insects can open and close the spiracles to keep water out.

Sharks and rays have a spiracle behind each eye. When the shark is not moving, the spiracle helps the shark to breathe.

Kookaburras are birds of the genus "Dacelo".

Kookaburras originally lived in Australia and New Guinea. Some were brought by humans to New Zealand between 1866 and 1880; but only those that were freed by Sir George Grey on Kawau Island are still there today.

Kookaburras usually eat small animals: small mammals (like mice), insects, small birds, lizards and snakes.
Kookaburras usually live in family groups. Young kookaburras help their parents to hunt and care for the smaller children.
Kookaburras are well known for their loud call, which sounds a bit like human laughter. Kookaburras use their calling to show others their territory.

In physics, mechanical energy describes the potential energy and kinetic energy present in the components of a mechanical system.
When a given amount of mechanical energy is transferred (such as when throwing a ball, lifting a box, crushing a soda can, or stirring a beverage) it is said that this amount of mechanical work has been done. Both mechanical energy and mechanical work are measured in the same units as energy in general. It is usually said that a component of a system has a certain amount of "mechanical energy" (i.e. it is a state function), whereas "mechanical work" describes the amount of mechanical energy a component has gained or lost.
The conservation of mechanical energy is a principle which states that under certain conditions, the total mechanical energy of a system is constant. This rule does not hold when mechanical energy is converted to other forms, such as chemical, nuclear, or electromagnetic. However, the principle of general conservation of energy is so far an unbroken rule of physics - as far as we know, energy cannot be created or destroyed, only changed in form.

Encryption is a method which allows information to be hidden so that it cannot be read without special knowledge or tools. Once this is done the information is encrypted. Decryption is a way to change an encrypted piece of information back into unencrypted form. This is called the decrypted form.

A common kind of encryption for words is ROT13. In ROT13, letters of the alphabet are changed with each other using a simple pattern. For example, "A" changes to "N", "B" changes to "O", "C" changes to "P", and so on. Each letter is "rotated" by 13 spaces. Using the ROT13 cipher, the words "Simple English Wikipedia" becomes "Fvzcyr Ratyvfu Jvxvcrqvn". The ROT13 ciper is easy to decrypt. Because there are 26 letters, if a letter is rotated two times by 13 letters each time, the original letter will be obtained.
Most kinds of encryption are more complex. Some are made only for text. Others are made for binary computer files like pictures and music. Today, the encryption system used the most is RSA. Any computer file can be encrypted with RSA.

Encryption is used on the Internet. Web sites use encryption to protect private information. The encryption on the internet is called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). It uses the RSA encryption system. The protocol for protected web browsing is called HTTPS.
Mostly URL encryption contain MD5 Algorithem. There are various alogorithm are available on the internet/market depending upon the need.

Vincenzo Bellini (born in Catania on November 3 1801; died near Paris on September 23 1835) was an Italian composer. He was one of the most important opera composers of the early 19th century. He gave his singers beautiful melodies to sing, with sensitive orchestral accompaniments. He never married, although he had some passionate love affairs, and he argued a lot with other composers such as Donizetti. His greatest operas are "I puritani", "La sonnambula" and "Norma". In the 1950s famous recordings were made of these operas by the legendary soprano Maria Callas.

A spectrometer is an optical instrument used to measure properties of light over a specific portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.
The independent variable is usually the wavelength of the light.
The variable measured is most often the light's intensity but could also, for instance, be the polarization state. A spectrometer is used in spectroscopy for producing spectral lines and measuring their wavelengths and intensities. Spectrometer is a term that is applied to instruments that operate over a very wide range of wavelengths, from gamma rays and X-rays into the far infrared.
In general, any particular instrument will operate over a small portion of this total range because of the different techniques used to measure different portions of the spectrum. Below optical frequencies (that is, at microwave, radio, and audio frequencies), the spectrum analyzer is a closely related electronic device.

Spectrometers are used in spectroscopic analysis to identify materials. Spectroscopes are used often in astronomy and some branches of chemistry. Early spectroscopes were simply a prism with graduations marking wavelengths of light. Modern spectroscopes, such as monochromators, generally use a diffraction grating, a movable slit, and some kind of photodetector, all automated and controlled by a computer. The spectroscope was invented by Gustav Robert Georg Kirchhoff and Robert Wilhelm Bunsen.

Legislature is a word that comes from the Latin language, meaning "those who write the laws." The legislature of a state or country is a group of people, each of whom got his or her office either by winning an election or by being appointed, to vote for the best laws. The way a legislature is supposed to work can usually be found in the constitution of that state or country.
In many countries, the legislature is called a Parliament or Congress. Sometimes the legislature is made up of two separate houses. This is called a "bicameral" legislature.
A county, district, city, or other small area also has a council, that makes the rules and laws for its level of government. The way a council works can usually be found in the area's "charter".

Carpe diem is a famous phrase from one of the poems of Horace.

The poem is originally from "Odes" 1.11. It is given in Latin and English below.

Especially during the Baroque era, the phrase was important. In the 17th century there was the Thirty Years' war, which lasted roughly from 1618 to 1648. For the people of the time, death was present almost everywhere. To compensate for that there were the concepts of "Carpe diem" (There is little time left, use it as best you can), "Vanitas" (Vanity; things are not what they seem), and Memento mori (Remember you will die).

A better translation of the phrase would probably be "pluck the day" (as a fruit might be plucked from a tree).

Since the end of the Second World War, many countries of the Europe wanted to have an organization to discuss various matters, especially security. Such discussion had continued since 1950s. Many years after,
in November 1972, leaders of 35 countries met in Helsinki. In 1973, these countries set up the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). By the end of 1990s, communist governments in many countries had changed. In this situation, the role of CSCE was also changing. The leaders from member countries of CSCE met in Paris. On 21st November 1990, they signed an agreement. This changed the name of Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) to Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). This international organization continues to function.

Daylight saving time (DST) is the local time adopted by many countries during summer. Typically, clocks are adjusted by moving the time forward by one hour in late winter or early spring. When DST ends in autumn, clocks are turned back to their the normal time.
DST was introduced in many countries to use the extra daylight available during summer. DST helps stores that sell to people after they get off work, but it hurts farmers and others whose hours are set by the sun. It cuts traffic accident rates. Sometimes it can reduce energy costs, but it can also increase them.
The United States, Australia (not Queensland or Western Australia), the United Kingdom, Canada and many other countries have DST. In Europe, DST is called summer time. Iceland and Kazakhstan are the only countries in Europe without DST.

The programming language has been changed many times do things in addition to changing text files. Sometimes perl code is written using many symbols besides letters and numbers, which can make those programs hard to read.
A lot of web pages are written using Perl, but it can be used to do all kinds of things on computers. It is very good at searching through text looking for patterns.
Perl was invented by Larry Wall, and he is working on a new version of it.

A gale is a very strong wind. The Beaufort scale is a way to measure weather conditions, based on observations. The first level of the scale that uses the word gale is 7 beaufort (of a total of 13 steps). There are other definitions as well. The U.S. Government's National Weather Service defines a gale as 34 to 47 knots (63 km/h to 87 km/h or 39 miles per hour to 54 miles per hour) of sustained surface winds. Forecasters typically issue gale warnings when winds of this strength are expected.
Other sources use minima as low as and maxima as high as. The definition is very non-standard. A common alternative definition of the maximum is.

A mushroom is the fruiting body of a kind of fungus. A toadstool is a poisonous mushroom.

It is hard to pick mushrooms in the wild, because most mushrooms have "look-alikes". Mushroom hunters learn how to tell these look-alikes apart, usually by chemical features. Edible mushrooms are used in cooking in many cultures and are usually grown in farms. In some places in the world, people learn already in childhood to recognize the edible and delicious mushrooms in the wild.

Most mushrooms have a stem and a cap. The bottom of the cap sometimes has gills to hold spores, and sometimes holds the spores themselves.

Toxicology is the study of the negative effects of chemicals on living things. The main factor in the "toxicity" of a substance is the dose (how much of the chemical has been given), as almost all substances can be toxic under the right conditions.
Many chemicals that we call poisons are only toxic when made into different chemicals by the body. Many chemicals are made toxic in the liver by enzymes, for example paracetamol, which is a common drug. There is also some variation in liver enzymes (caused by genetic variation) in different people that can cause a substance to be more toxic in one person than it is in another. Some substances are also only toxic when they are with other chemicals, as one liver enzyme can cause activity in another enzyme.

Sydney is a city on the east coast of Australia. Sydney is the capital city of New South Wales. About 4 million people live in Sydney and it is the biggest city in Australia.
Arthur Phillip was born in Britain and founded Sydney in 1788. The first white people who lived there were prisoners from England and Ireland.
In Sydney, there are many famous buildings: the Sydney Opera House and the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Sydney has a big harbour and lots of beaches. The most famous beach is Bondi Beach, some other beaches are Coogee Beach. Famous parts of the harbour are Darling Harbour and Circular Quay.
The most famous sports ground in Sydney is Stadium Australia (Now Telstra Stadium) because it was made for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. Another stadium in Sydney is the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG).
Sydney has lots of things to see and do. These include visiting Taronga Zoo (a park for animals), eating food, looking at art or watching sports (like cricket or football). Sydney also has some of Australia's best shopping. Lots of people go to Sydney for the big party at New Years Eve with fireworks over the harbour.

Bobcat ("Lynx rufus") are fierce cats that live in forests, swamps, mountains, prairie, and deserts in much of North America. Bobcats are generally nocturnal (most active at night), but have peaks of activity at dawn and dusk. They spend the day in their den (a cave, hollow log or rock crevice). They are excellent climbers and swimmers. Bobcats are preyed upon by by cougars, coyotes, wolves, owls, and people. Bobcats have a life span of 10-14 years. The bobcats and the lynx are closely related.

The Bobcat has powerful jaws and long, pointed canine teeth. It has sharp, retractable claws, big ears, and a spotted coat. Many bobcats have long tufts of hair at the tip of the ears that improve the cat's hearing. The brown eyes have circular pupils. These graceful cats are from 24 to 40 inches (60-100 cm) long (including the tail). The stubby tail is only 4 to 7 inches (10-18 cm) long, and looks as though it was cut off (or bobbed). This is what this cat is named for.

Bobcats are carnivores (meat-eaters). These fast, solitary hunters eat small mammals (like rabbits, hares, rodents, foxes, weasels, and even the occasional small deer), birds, fish, and eggs. Bobcats stalk their prey, and then pounce onto it. They can leap up to 10 feet (3 m). They can often kill their prey in one powerful bite.

Mandrake is the common name of a number of plants in the Nightshade family, genus Mandragora. The roots often look like man or woman, or can be easily made to resemble them. The plant has been used in witchcraft for a long time.
According to this literature, the plant shrieks in pain, when it is pulled from the ground. This shriek is able to make a person deaf. He might also loose his mind, or even be killed, if he is unprotected.
Mandrake (Mandragora officinalis) has been used as an anaestethic for a long time. For this, it was usually prepared in an alcoholic solution.

Crinoids, also known as "sea lilies" or "feather-stars", are marine animals. They make up the class Crinoidea of the echinoderms (phylum Echinodermata). They live both in shallow water and in depths as great as 6000 meters. Crinoids are characterized by a mouth on the top surface that is surrounded by feeding arms. They have a U-shaped gut, and their anus is located next to the mouth. Although the basic echinoderm pattern of fivefold symmetry can be recognized, most crinoids have many more than five arms. Crinoids usually have a stem they use to attach themselves to a substrate, but many live attached only as juveniles and become free-swimming as adults. There are only a few hundred known modern forms, but crinoids were much more common both in species and numbers in the past. Some thick limestone beds dating to the mid- to late-Paleozoic are entirely made up of disarticulated crinoid fragments.

The Trans-Siberian Railway or Trans-Siberian Railroad is a set of railways that goes from Moscow and European Russia to the Russian Far East provinces, Mongolia, China and the Sea of Japan.
Because Russia is such a big country, travel from one end and the other is an important problem. In the 1890s, the Russians began building the longest railway in the world to connect Moscow to the Pacific Ocean. Before the railway was built, the trip took about a year along very rough roads. One reason for building the "Trans-Sib" was military: to transport troops to the East in order to protect the country against Japan and China. Another reason was to transport food from the farming areas of south-western Siberia to the people in the European part of Russia. Many cities and industries are built up along the route of the Trans-Siberian Railway.

A tunnel is an underground passage. Some tunnels are used for cars, and others are used for trains. Sometimes, a tunnel is used for movement of ships. Some tunnels are built for communication cables and some are built for electricity cables. Other tunnels are built for animals.
Tunnels are dug in different kinds of grounds, from soft sand to hard rock. The way of digging is chosen by the type of ground. There are two additional ways of digging: quarry and 'cut and cover'. In quarry, the tunnel path is drilled in a horizontal way.
This system requires a deep tunnel that's built in a firm rock. In the 'cut and cover' system, a tunnel is dug in the ground and afterwards a roof is built above the tunnel. This system fits tunnels that are close to the ground like road tunnels and infrastructure.
Building tunnels is a large civil engineering project that could cost very high sums of money. The planning and building of a long tunnel may take many years.
The Channel Tunnel between France and England is one of the longest tunnels in the world. It is 50 kilometers long. The longest tunnel in the world, the "Gotthard Base Tunnel", is being dug in Switzerland.

President pro tempore of the United States Senate
President "pro tempore" of the United States Senate is the longest serving Senator from a major political party in the United States Senate. According to the Constitution, this is the fourth highest office in the United States. It is the third in the presidential line of succession (behind the Vice President and the Speaker of the House).
Officially the Vice President is person in charge of the Senate, but he is not a Senator. Robert Byrd (D-WV) is the President pro tempore. When the Vice President cannot be in charge, the President pro tempore is in charge of the Senate. Many people still think of the President pro tempore as "de facto" president of the Senate. During President Andrew Johnson's impeachment trial in 1868 president pro tempore Benjamin Wade was the first person in the line of succession. No president pro tempore has taken over the presidency as of 2006.
Probably the most famous Presidents pro tempore were John Langdon (first in this office), David Rice Atchison (D-MO), Benjamin Wade (R-OH), Arthur Vandenberg (R-MI), Strom Thurmond (R-SC), and Robert Byrd (D-WV).
When Senator Hubert Humphrey, a former Vice President of the United States, was seriously ill the Senate showed its respect for him by creating the office of Deputy President Pro tem for any Vice President who is elected to the Senate. Only Humphrey has done this.

Bioinformatics is the study of big amounts of biological information. Mostly focusing on molecules like DNA. It is done mostly with the help of computers.

Anything a cell could possibly want is stored in its DNA. When a cell wants to build a protein, it finds the appropriate piece of DNA, unravels it, and uses it to make the protein.
Proteins are made from "amino acids". There are twenty amino acids in each protein molecule. Proteins are the 'machinery' of a cell. They can perform many functions like transportation, structural support, movement and metabolism.
The principle of bioinformatics is that everything making up these molecules can be studied by studying the DNA in it and therefore find out more about how it work.

Chemists have developed ways for understanding the shape and behavior of small molecules, using mathematical analysis. They might use computers (or even just a pencil and paper) to study these molecules.
Biochemists today are trying to answer these questions about every single cell in the body.

Edda or the plural Eddas or Eddur, including "Poetic Edda" (or Older Edda) and "Prose Edda" (or Younger Edda), are two collections of stories about Viking deities. They were made in around 9th to 13th century by Icelandic Christian historians.
Although the Eddur are the most important written records remaining today about Norse mythology, they are not very reliable because Christians hated pagan religions, and they changed the original tales to make the Norse gods and goddesses look silly, lusty, and barbaric.
The term "Edda" most likely refers to Oddi, a place where both Saemund Sigfusson (a cleric who is rumoured author of Older Edda), and Snorri Sturluson (a Christian politician, author of Younger Edda) lived.

Whipped cream is a dairy food used in many desserts. It is made with heavy cream, a type of cream that contains a large amount of fat.

To make whipped cream, a person whips or beats the heavy cream with a whisk or an electric mixer until it becomes fluffy and filled with air. For some desserts, people add icing sugar as a sweetener. Some people also add flavourings to whipped cream, such as vanilla.

Whipped cream is used in many types of desserts. Some desserts, such as apple pie or strawberry shortcake, are often served with whipped cream on top. Whipped cream is also served in milk shakes and on ice cream sundaes. Some desserts have whipped cream inside them, such as cream puffs and eclairs.

Biology is the science of life and living things, like plants, animals, fungi (such as mushrooms), and bacteria. People who study biology are called biologists.
"What are the characteristics of this living thing?" (What makes it different from other living things?)
"How should we group this living thing?"
"What does this living thing do?"
Biology looks at how animals and other organisms behave and work, and what they are like. Biology also studies how organisms react with each other and the environment.
Biology as a science has existed for hundreds of years, and it has many research fields and branches. Many of those branches are seen as independent.
Like all sciences, biology uses the scientific method. This means that biologists must be able to show evidence for their ideas, and that other biologists must be able to test the ideas for themselves.

Biology is known widely as a form of magic which was invented by evil Scottish scientist David Renfrew on a twenty-year long quest to count all the pine needles in the United States. While attempting to find himself, and count such needles, he decided to devise this evil form of magic to torment high school age students.

Ascension means - following Christian doctrine - that Jesus bodily ascended to heaven in the presence of his apostles, forty days following his resurrection.
In this context the term "heaven" means a physical reunion of Christ with God the Father. That makes a difference to a concept of spiritual transformation and experience of the Divine which is common to the mystical traditions of many world religions. It is narrated in Mark, Luke, Acts, and.
This is affirmed by Christian liturgy in the Apostles' Creed and the Nicene Creed.
Ascension Day is officially celebrated on a Thursday, the fortieth day of Easter. However not all countries hold the feast on this day. The feast is one of the ecumenical feasts (i.e., universally celebrated), ranking with the feasts of the Passion, of Easter and of Pentecost among the most solemn in the ecclesiastical calendar.

The observance of this feast is of great antiquity. Although no documentary evidence of it exists prior to the beginning of the fifth century, St. Augustine says that it is of Apostolic origin, and he speaks of it in a way that shows it was the universal observance of the Church long before his time.

In Diabetes Insipidus, there is a chemical missing from the blood that helps the body to keep liquid inside. This chemical is known as ADH, and is part of a group of blood chemicals known as Hormones. ADH is released from a part of the body called the Brain, and travels in the blood to the parts of the body that make urine, known as the Kidneys. Here, it makes the body take water out of the urine, which reduces the amount of urine stored in the bladder.
If there is no ADH in the blood, no water is taken out of the urine, and much more will be kept in the bladder. This means you need to go to the toilet more often.

Finnegans Wake is the last book written by the Irish writer James Joyce. It was published in 1939.
He started to work on this book in 1924 and published parts of it under the titles "A New Unnamed Work" and "Work in Progress" He did not complete until seventeen years later, in 1939. During this time he faced many hardships, such as having no money, eye problems and family problems.
"Finnegans Wake" is a very hard book to read, even for people who read a lot of literature, because Joyce uses several languages and creates new words that come from combinations of old and new English and other languages as well.
It can be understood as the story of Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker and his family. But it is an experiment more than a story.

Gulls, also called seagulls, are birds. They form the family "Laridae", in the order "Charadriiformes".
There are many different types of gull but most of them are white, with grey or black wings, a yellow beak and are about the size of a chicken (but some are smaller). Gulls can eat most types of food but like meat more than anything else. They look around for discarded food and dead animals to eat as well as hunting and have learned how to live and breed in the same places as people. Most types of seagull are awake during the day and sleep at night. They like to sleep on water, like lakes or the sea when the water is calm.
Gulls used to be found only near the sea, as they are water birds with webbed feet for swimming. They are more common inland these days because they can find food wherever people live, often on garbage dumps or in the streets of towns and cities. Seagulls are intelligent compared to other birds and have a very complicated system of noises and body movements that they use to talk to other seagulls.
Most types of seagull breed once a year and have two or three chicks (babies). Mother gulls are very protective of their eggs and chicks and will sometimes fight to the death to defend them.

An Inkjet printer is a printer for computers. It uses special ink to print on the paper. Another type of printing techology is the Laser printer.
Usually, inkjet printers are used by people who print very little. The ink comes in special ink cartridges, which can be very expensive and uneconomical. Also, the ink in the cartridge may dry up. This means that a new cartridge is needed.
Many professionals use inkjet printers to print on very large surfaces (up to 5m width). These printers usually do not use cartridges, but have a continuous supply of ink that could last for a long time.

Pneumonia is a disease of the lungs and the respiratory system. The lung contains many small bulbs, or sacs, called alveoli. These help to take out oxygen from the air. In the case of pneumonia, these bulbs become inflamed. They fill up with a fluid, and can no longer absorb as much oxygen as before.
Pneumonia can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites. It can also be caused by chemical or physical damage done to the lungs. Other illnesses, like alcohol abuse or lung cancer, can also result in pneumonia.
People with pneumonia usually have difficulty breathing. They may also cough, or have pains in the chest area. The treatment of pneumonia depends on how the illness was caused. If it was caused by bacteria, antibiotics can be used to treat it.
People of all ages can have pneumonia. The disease is dangerous. Many people die from pneumonia, especially old people, or people with a weak immune system.

The Chinese Civil War was fought from 1927 to 1949. On one side were the Communists, who wanted to make China like the Soviet Union. They were backed by the Soviet Union, and they had the support of many poor people. On the others side were the Nationalists, who wanted to make China like the United States. They were also called the Guomindang. They were backed by the United States and the United Kingdom, and they had the support of the richer people and the Chinese who lived in cities. More than a million people died in the Chinese Civil War. The Communists were lead by Mao Zedong, and the Nationalists were lead by Chiang Kai-shek.
Sometimes the two groups stopped fighting and helped each other. One time this happened was when Japan invaded China during World War II. But soon they started fighting again. Eventually, in 1949, the Communists chased the Nationalists out of the biggest part of China, the mainland. The Nationalists came to an island called Taiwan, and stayed there. Mao named China the People's Republic of China and he became its leader until he died in 1976. Today, the two sides still do not like each other, but they aren't fighting any more.

A convict is "a person found guilty of a crime and sentenced by a court" or "a person serving a sentence in prison". A convict is sometimes simply called a "con". After a conviction, convicts often become prisoners in a gaol. People convicted and sentenced but not sent to gaol are not usually called "convicts".

One use of the word means the huge numbers of prisoners who filled British gaols in the 1700's and early 1800s. Many were sent to the American colonies as cheap workers, but that stopped after the War of Independence.
British convicts were transported to the Georgia (US State) between 1733 and the American Revolution. After this, Britain looked to the newly discovered east coast of Australia to use as a penal colony. Convicts were transported to Australia in 1788, the very start of European settlement. They were used as cheap workers in 5 out of the 6 major colonies. Transportation was stopped in 1868. British convicts were also sent to Canada and India. France also sent convicts to French Guiana and New Caledonia. Russian criminals who were sent to Siberia can be called convicts.

The TIME service is an Internet protocol defined in RFC 868. Its purpose is to provide a site-independent, machine readable date and time.
TIME can operate over either TCP or UDP. When operating over TCP, a host connects to a server that supports the TIME protocol on TCP port 37. The server then sends the time as a 32-bit unsigned binary number in network byte order representing a number of seconds since 00:00 (midnight) 1 January, 1900 GMT and closes the connection. The host receives the time and closes the connection.
When operating over UDP, the client sends a (usually empty) datagram to UDP port 37. The server responds with a single datagram of length 4 containing the time. There is no connection setup or teardown.

Zarathushtra was an ancient prophet. He lived in Iran. Zoroaster of English language is same as Zarathushtra. He founded a religion named Zoroastrianism. This religion has a long history. It was the national religion of Sassanian Empire of ancient Iran. In Persian language, the name takes the form of "Zartosht".
Most of the scholars agree that Zoroaster was a real person who lived long back. No one is certain about the time when he lived. Estimates tell that he lived about 3200 years before, around 1200 BC. Some other estimates tell that Zarathushtra may have lived anywhere between the 18th century BC and the 6th century BC.

A sprain is a type of injury in which a person hurts the part really bad, but it is not broken. It has common side affects of a broken bone, but it is less serious.

The first degree is only a minor tear or stretch of a ligament.
The second degree is a tear of a ligament, which is usually followed by pain or swelling.

Sprains can best be prevented by proper use of safety equipment (wrist, ankle guards), warm-ups and cool-downs (including stretching), being aware of your surroundings and maintaining strength and flexibility. Physical conditioning is the best way to avoid or lessen the degree of sprains.

Midwestern United States/VGA stub
The Midwestern United States (or Midwest) is a name for the north-central states of the United States of America. The states that are part of the Midwest are: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin.
The word "Midwest" has been in common use for over 100 years. Other names for the area are no longer used. These names include the "Northwest" or "Old Northwest", "Mid-America," or "the Heartland". Since 1929, sociologists have often used the Midwest as "typical" of the entire nation.
The land in the Midwest is generally thought of as being flat. This is true of several areas in the Midwest, but there are parts that are not flat. For example, the eastern Midwest near the Appalachian Mountains, the Great Lakes basin, and northern parts of Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Iowa are not flat. Prairies cover most of the states west of the Mississippi River. Less rain falls in the western Midwest than in the eastern part. This causes different types of prairies. Most of the Midwest can now be called either "urban areas" or "agricultural areas". Areas in northern Minnesota, Michigan and Wisconsin, and the Ohio River valley are not very developed.

Westmorland (an older spelling is "Westmoreland", an even older spelling is "Westmerland") is an area of north west England and one of the 39 historic counties of England. It was an administrative county from 1889 to 1974 and now is part of Cumbria.

At the time of the Domesday Book in 1086 the county was said to form part of Yorkshire.
The historic county borders are with Cumberland to the north, County Durham and Yorkshire to the east, and Lancashire to the south and west.
The highest point of the county is Helvellyn at 950m (3,117 ft). According to the 1831 census its area was 485,990 acres.
Appleby, the historic county town, made a historic borough.
In 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, the county was abolished and its former area was combined with Cumberland and parts of Lancashire and Yorkshire to form the new county of Cumbria. The former county now forms part of the districts of South Lakeland and Eden.

The 1976 Pacific hurricane season was an ongoing event in tropical cyclone formation. Hurricanes Kathleen, Liza, and Madeline are the most notable storms this year. Hurricane Kathleen caused death and destruction in California and Arizona because of flooding. Hurricane Liza was the deadliest storm of the season when it killed over 600 people in Mexico. Hurricane Madeline is notable for being the second-most intense Pacific hurricane at landfall.

Kathleen was a costly and damaging storm mainly in Nevada, California and Arizona. It also killed 7 people.

Liza was very deadly and the third deadliest ever behind Hurricane Paul and the Mexico hurricane.

Madeline became the the third storm in the row to make landfall in Mexico. It was also the most intense.

Maglev trains are a very fast type of train. Magnetic levitation is a technology that uses magnetic fields to make the train move. These fields lift the train a small distance above the tracks and moves the train. They are much faster than regular trains. By 2035, a trip from Toronto to Vancouver will take 3 hours. This same trip takes three days on a regular train. After this technology has been perfected, people will be able to travel faster across land on a maglev train than they would in an airplane.
The highest known speed of a maglev train is. This was done in Japan in 2003

The Tooth fairy is a fictional character found in modern folklore.
Around the world, families have many different traditions to celebrate the loss of a child's tooth, especially a first tooth. Many of the traditions involve throwing a tooth on a roof, under a house, burying it under a tree, or leaving it for a rodent.
One of the most famous traditions is leaving a tooth under a pillow for the Tooth Fairy. This tradition is very popular in the United States as well as other countries. The Tooth Fairy will take the tooth away while the child is sleeping and leave some money in its place. Sometimes the Tooth Fairy may also leave a note. If the child does not go to sleep the Tooth Fairy will not come.
Some people believe that the Tooth Fairy is named Fatina and lives in Neverland, along with Tinkerbell. The belief is that Fatina creates a magic powder from children's teeth that protects the fairies from hawks who might otherwise eat them.

Emergency Medicine is a specialty of medicine. A specialty is a special part of medicine where a doctor may have more knowledge. Examples are Pediatrics (doctors who care for children), Geriatrics (doctors who care for elderly people), and Cardiology (doctors who know more about the heart.)
Emergency Medicine (abbreviation EM) is sometimes also called "Accident and Emergency Medicine" (AEM).
EM doctors specialize in treating diseases and injuries that need "immediate" care. These kind of diseases or injuries are called "emergencies". If they are not helped quickly, the person may become more sick or even die.
Doctors that specialize in EM usually work in Emergency Departments. This is also called an Accident and Emergency Ward. These are places in hospitals where people go if they have an emergency. They may have a red cross or red letters on the sign to show it is the Emergency Department. This way, even people who cannot read know where to go.
Doctors who specialize in EM must know some about all of the different specialties of medicine. They treat people of all ages. They treat both men and women. They must know how to treat any kind of emergency. But they may not know "quite" as much about the "chronic" treatments of diseases over years. However, many people come to the Emergency Department with problems that are not emergencies. So EM doctors must also know about how to treat "non"-emergencies.

The Thinker (French: "Le Penseur") is a famous bronze statue made by the sculptor Auguste Rodin, which portrays a man sitting and thinking with his arm bends on his knee and his chin on his hand. Though this statue is widely known as "The Thinker," Rodin first called it "The Poet". It was part of a commission by the Museum of Decorative Arts in Paris to create a huge gate based on the epic poem "The Divine Comedy" of Dante. Each of the statues in the piece represented one of the main characters in the poem. "The Thinker" was originally meant to depict Dante himself in front of the Gates of Hell, considering his great poem.
Over twenty casts of the sculpture exist; they are now in museums around the world. Some of those copies are enlarged versions of the original work, while others have somewhat different proportions.

A goalkeeper is someone who protects a team's goal. There are goalkeepers in sports like football (soccer) and ice hockey, for example. The goalkeeper's mission is to prevent the opposing team from scoring a goal. Goalkeepers normally wear more protective gear than other players on the team but this is not always true.

A goalkeeper's kit (or "uniform") consists of shin guards and gloves to protect his hands from the impact of the ball when he catches it.
Historically, however, until the 1970s goalkeepers would wear little or no hand protection.
Until the early 20th century, the goalkeeper would often wear the same coloured strip as his teammates, with the only different item of clothing being his cap. However, in 1909, the Scottish Football Association took steps to ensure the goalkeeper would wear a different colour from the outfield players. This was to show his different role, as the only player allowed to handle the ball.

The goalkeeper in ice hockey (a "Goalie") uses thicker padding than the other players on the team. This is to prevent damage caused by being hit by the puck. The hockey stick of the goalie is much wider than the stick of other players. The bottom edge is also longer and flatter. The goalie has a very large leather glove on one hand. This glove has a large area to help catch the puck. Goalies normally wear masks that give protection to the entire face and head as well as the neck.

Nectar, in botany, is a liquid made by the flowers of plants. It is very sweet because it has a lot of sugar in it. Plants make nectar to attract pollinating animals. It is made in glands called nectaries. The Nectaries are usually at the bottom of the perianth. This means the animal trying to get the nectar have to touch the parts of the plant that are used for reproduction. By doing this, the animal getting the nectar helps the plants reproduce. Some plants make nectar outside the flower. These plants do it to attract predatory insects. These insects will eat both the nectar and any plant-eating insects found near the plant.
Nectar is economically important because it is where the sugar for honey comes from. It is also useful in agriculture and horticulture because the adults of many predatory insects, as well as hummingbirds, eat nectar. Nectar from fruits can also be drank by people.

Fred McDowell (January 12 1904 - July 3 1972) (also known as Mississippi Fred McDowell) was a Delta blues singer and guitar player. His parents died when he was young.

McDowell was born in Rossville, Tennessee, near Memphis. He started playing guitar when he was 14 and played at parties around where he lived.

McDowell moved to Memphis in 1926 where he played for money. Soon after, he moved to Como, Mississippi in 1940 or 1941 and worked as a farmer. He still played at parties.
Mostly, he played slide guitar using a pocket knife and then a slide made from a beef rib bone, later switching to a glass slide. He played with the slide on his ring finger.

In the 1950s, people became more interested in Blues Music and McDowell became more famous. He recorded for the first time in 1959 with Alan Lomax and Shirley Collins. He started playing on electric guitar rather than acoustic but said "I do not play no rock and roll". He taught Bonnie Raitt the slide guitar technique, and was written about by The Rolling Stones'.

McDowell's first album came out in 1969, called "I Do Not Play No Rock 'N' Roll".

McDowell died of cancer in 1972 and is buried at Hammond Hill M.B. Church, between Como and Senatobia.

The Apollo program (or Project Apollo) was a project by the United States' National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The goal was to send a human to explore the Moon and bring him home to earth safe. It was started by U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1961. The first person to walk on the Moon was Neil Armstrong of Apollo 11 on June 20, 1969.
One reason the program started was that the Soviet Union was the first country to send a person into outer space. Since this was during the Cold War, many in the U.S. thought that the U.S. needed to stay ahead of the USSR in space exploration.
The Apollo program ended in 1972. After that, NASA began to work on the Space Shuttle program, the International Space Station, and many unmanned space exploration projects.

Eratosthenes of Cyrene (Greek; 276 BC - 194 BC) was a Greek mathematician, poet, athlete, geographer and astronomer. He made several remarkable discoveries and inventions: he invented a system of latitude and longitude. He was the first person to calculate the circumference of the Earth (with remarkable accuracy), and the tilt of the earth's axis (again with remarkable accuracy); he may also have accurately calculated the distance from the earth to the sun and invented the leap day. He also created a map of the world based on the available geographical knowledge of the era. Eratosthenes was also the founder of scientific chronology; he wanted to fix the dates of the chief literary and political events from the conquest of Troy.

A saxophone is a musical instrument that is made of brass and often just called a "sax".
Due to the fact it is made from brass it is often involved in what is referred to as a brass section alongside true brass instruments like the trumpet or trombone. However, it is not a true brass instrument but a member of the woodwind family of instruments because it has a reed. It was developed from the clarinet and shares many similarities to the clarinet. The player blows into a reed fitted into the mouthpiece of the instrument. The instrument is rarely used in a classical orchestra.
There are several different kinds of saxophone. In order from low to high pitch they are: Tubax, Contrabass, Bass, Baritone, Tenor, Alto, Soprano, Sopranino, and Soprillo. However, only the baritone, tenor, alto, and soprano are in common use.
It was invented in 1842 by Adolphe Sax and is very popular with modern rock and pop musicians, and often used in jazz music. The big bands of the 1940s and 1950s always used it too. Famous saxophone players were Marcel Mule (classical music) and Charlie Parker (jazz music).
The saxophone family is known as a transpositional family of instruments due to the fact that you do not have to alter the fingering when playing different ones.

A Sponge is a tool. It is used for cleaning and washing. The sponge is made of a special material, with many holes. By rubbing the sponge against dirt, the dirt can be removed.
Today, there are also artificial sponges.

Most natural sponges used for cleaning today come from the Mediterranean and the Caribbean. Today Izmir and Tripolis are the main markets were natural sponges are sold.

Sponges have medicinal potential. This is because of antimicrobial compounds in either the sponge itself or their microbial symbionts.

Bottlenose dolphins have been seen using live sponges. This was in Shark Bay. Shark bay is in Western Australia. The behaviour has only been observed in the bay. Most likely adult dolphins teach it to their children. The only other marine mammals that use tools are Sea otters.

Irvine, North Ayrshire
Irvine (Gaelic: "Irbhinn") is a coastal new town in North Ayrshire, Scotland.
Irvine was the site of Scotland's 12th century Military Capital and former headquarters of the Lord High Constable of Scotland, Hugh de Morville. It also served as the Capital of Cunninghame.
The town was once a haunt of Robert Burns, after whom two streets in the town are named: Burns Street and Burns Crescent. He is known to have worked in a flax mill on the Glasgow Vennell. Despite being classed as a new town, Irvine has had a long history stretching back many centuries and was classed as a Royal Burgh. There are also conflicting rumours that Mary, Queen of Scots was briefly involved in the town's history. Some say she stayed briefly at Seagate Castle. To this day there is still an annual festival, called Marymass, held in the town.
Irvine is the birthplace of the present Deputy First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon and the former First Minister of Scotland, Jack McConnell. Its twin town is Saint-Amand-les-Eaux in northern France just outside Lille.

Helsinki is the capital city of Finland. Helsinki is the largest city in Finland. 550,000 people live in Helsinki, and 1 000 000 live in the Helsinki metropolitan area.
Helsinki is on the coast of the Gulf of Finland. When one looks from Helsinki, Tallinn is on the opposite side of the sea, but it is too far away to see. A poetic name for Helsinki is "the daughter of the Baltic Sea".

In 1550 Swedish king Gustav Vasa commanded people to build a new city and move there. His idea was to build a new place to trade, which would be more popular than Tallinn. The idea didn't work well, and many people returned from Helsinki to their homes. Later Sweden built the fortress Suomenlinna in Helsinki. After Russia had taken Finland from Sweden in several wars, they started developing Helsinki. Helsinki became the capital of autonomous province of Finland. When Finland became independent in 1917, Helsinki stayed as the capital city.

Helsinki spreads around several bays and over several islands. Some famous islands include Seurasaari, Lauttasaari and Korkeasaari - which is also the country's biggest zoo - as well as the fortress island of Suomenlinna (Sveaborg).

Mutual authentication or two-way authentication (sometimes written as 2WAY authentication) refers to two parties authenticating each other correctly. In technology terms, it refers to a client or user authenticating themselves to a server and that server authenticating itself to the user in such a way that both parties are assured of the others' identity.
Typically, this is done for a client process and a server process without user interaction.
Mutual SSL provides the same things as SSL, with the addition of authentication and non-repudiation of the client authentication, using digital signatures. However, due to issues with complexity, cost, logistics, and effectiveness, most web applications are designed so they do not require client-side certificates. This creates an opening for a man-in-the-middle attack, in particular for online banking.

Pedipalps are the two "feelers" on a spider's face. Some spiders seem to have ten legs and not eight, because these pedipalps look like an extra pair of legs. But the pedipalps are more similar to arms. Spiders often use these to hold small animals (for example crickets) for them to eat.
Male (father) spiders also use pedipalps for mating- for making baby spiders. The male spiders put sperm onto a piece of web (the spider's "house"), and then put their pedipalps into the sperm. The pedipalps then hold the sperm, and the spider can use it to mate with a female (mother spider).

Sauce is a hot or a cold liquid that is added to another food to add flavor to it. Sauces are not eaten by themselves, they are always added to another dish. A sauce can be something simple, like liquid butter or something fancier like a sauce with cream and ham (called "Carbonara") or with ground meat (called "Bolognese"), or even with herbs and garlic (called "Pesto").
An example would be a tomato-based sauce that is usually poured over spaghetti before it is eaten. Gravy is a brown sauce served with meat.

Athletics, known as Track and Field in the United States, has been contested at every Summer Olympics since the birth of the modern Olympic movement at the 1896 Summer Olympics.
Men's events.
No new events have been added to the men's athletics programme since 1952 when the short racewalk was added. The roster of events has not changed since then, with the exception of the omission of the long racewalk in 1976. The long racewalk is the only event held for men but not included on the women's programme.
A total of 52 different events have been held in the men's competition. The current list has 24 events.
Many of the discontinued events were similar to modern ones but at different lengths, especially in the steeplechasing, hurdling, and racewalking disciplines.
Team racing events were only run in the six early editions of the Games.
The athletic multi-discipline "triathlon" (3 events) and "pentathlon" (5 events) have been replaced by the 10 event "decathlon", and the medley relay replaced by relay races where each section is the same length as the others.
Standing jump competitions are no longer held, nor are the various modified throwing events which were experimented with in 1908 and 1912.

It was Linkin Park's first record. Before it, in 1997, the band only made a demo tape called "Xero". The band changed its name later in 1999, after Chester Bennington replaced Mark Wakefield as the lead singer.

Only one thousand were made, and the EP was sent to different record labels, such as Warner Bros. Records. The rest of the copies of the EP were sent to the first members of Linkin Park's fan club.
On November 19, 2001, Linkin Park Underground, Linkin Park's fan club, was made. The first fan club package that was sent to members had a new edition of "Hybrid Theory EP", with a note from the band. The first 500 copies of the CD were signed by all 6 members of the band.
The only ways to get the EP are to buy it from eBay, or win a contest in the Linkin Park Underground when the EP is awarded as a contest prize. But the prizes awarded by the LPU are the original EP.

Melville Island is a member of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, Canada with an area of. No one lives on Melville Island. It is the 33rd biggest island in the world and Canada's 8th biggest island. Melville Island is shared by the Northwest Territories, which has the western half of the island, and Nunavut, which has the eastern half. The mountains on Melville Island are some of the biggest in the western Canadian Arctic. Some of them reach heights of one kilometre.
Melville Island was first visited by the British explorer Sir William Parry in 1819. Not only did he find the island, but he had to spend the winter at what is now called "Winter Harbour", until August 1, 1820. The island is named for Robert Dundas, 2nd Viscount Melville who was First Sea Lord at the time.

The Argus As 014 was a pulse jet engine used on the German V-1 flying bomber of World War II. This was meant to be a simple model that would have been easy to make a lot of for not very much money. The engine was made from a sheet of steel that was rolled into a tube. A shutter was placed at one of the ends of the tube, along with a fuel valve and an igniter (something that lights things on fire).
It was thought that this could become a good power source for some last ditch German fighters during the last few days of World War II.

Lawrence Mark "Larry" Sanger (born July 16 1968) is a person who worked with Jimmy Wales to create the internet encyclopedias Nupedia and Wikipedia before he created his own online encyclopedias Digital Universe and Citizendium.
Wales, through his company Bomis, paid Sanger to help them to maintain Nupedia, an internet encyclopedia.
On January 2 2001, Ben Kovitz, Sanger's friend, had the idea to use a wiki to help to make Nupedia better. Sanger in turn told Wales, and on January 10 2001 Wikipedia was launched. There is differing opinions on which of the three people are most responsible for Wikipedia.
In 2005, Sanger created Digital Universe, an online encyclopedia like Wikipedia.
In 2006, Sanger created Citizendium, another online encyclopedia. Citizendium uses the MediaWiki engine (like Wikipedia) but rules are different. People must use their given names on Citizendium and need to be experts in the fields that they edit in.

A wildebeest (also called Gnu) is an animal. It is a large hoofed mammal, that is part of the "Bovidae" familiy of animals. There are two species of wildebeest. Both live in Africa.

Wildebeest grow to 1.15 to 1.40 metres (at the shoulder) and they weigh between 150 and 250 kilograms when they are fully grown. They live in the plains and open woodlands in southern Africa. The biggest herds can be found in the Serengeti desert. (see below) Wildebeest can live for more than 20 years.

Like other members of the same family (antelopes, deer and goats, amongst others), they mainly eat grass (scientists call such animals "Herbivores", which means: "eating grass"). But since in the African grasslands, there is not always grass, wildebeest are forced to wander (Scientists speak about "migrations") to find food all year round. In May, about 1.5 million animals move from the grasslands to the woods. In November they move back; there is grass in the plains in summer.

The cows (the female Gnus) will calve (give birth to the young) in summer in the plains. After the females have given birth, the breeding season begins. The dominant males mark off (and defend) some territory. They do this with feces, and with scent.
Wildebeest are an important part of the ecosystem. With their dung, they fertilize the ground, and their trampling is good for new growth. They also provide food for predators, like lions and hyenas.

A sundial shows the current solar time during the day. It does this because the sun appears to move through the sky. At different times in the day when the sun is shining, a shadow is cast in different places on the dial. A person marks the dial with the time at a certain shadow. This lets users easily see the time. There are a few commonly seen designs, such as the 'ordinary' or standard garden sundial. However, sundials can be designed for any surface where a fixed object casts a predictable shadow.
Ancient Egypt had sundials. Other cultures developed them further, including the Greeks and Romans.

The Concertmaster (American English) or leader (British English) is the most important violinist in an orchestra. He or she will sit in the front seat, by the conductor's left. The word "concertmaster" comes from the German "Konzertmeister".
The leader will be the highest paid member of the orchestra. He has to decide how the violins will play the music and write in the bowing. He will decide where each member of the violins should sit. He will probably also interview them and offer them the job in the orchestra. He will talk to the conductor about anything the orchestra are not happy about (he may have to remind the conductor when it is time to stop the rehearsal!). If part of the music is marked "solo" then he will play it as a solo while the other violins stop playing.
In the United States it is usual for the concertmaster to be on the platform before the concert and to tell the orchestra to tune their instruments, playing on his A string to give them the correct pitch. In European orchestras it is usually the oboe that gives an A for tuning. In Britain the leader usually comes on stage after the orchestra have tuned, and gets an applause.

A lighthouse is a tall house that has a light placed near the top. Lighthouses are built on the coast of an ocean or lake. The lighthouse is meant to protect ships from crashing into shore by sending the light out towards the sea. The light usually turns in a circle so that ships see a flashing light. The light is usually covered by a Fresnel lens. This lens enables the light to travel a far distance.
One of the most famous lghthouses was the Lighthouse of Alexandria. It was located on an island near the coast. That Island was called "Pharos". Even today, many languages use a word that comes from the name of the island, to stand for a lighthouse.
Almost all lighthouses are automatic now.

A chain letter is a message that tries to cause the person who gets it to make copies of the letter and then pass them on to as many people as possible. A chain letter can be a type of meme. Common ways used in chain letters include stories that make the recipient feel sorry for the person, get-rich-quick pyramid schemes, and the use of superstition to threaten the recipient with bad luck, physical violence or death if he or she "breaks the chain" and does not follow the instructions given in the letter.

Bartolomeo Tromboncino (born Verona around 1470; died in or near Venice in 1535 or later) was an Italian composer. He lived in the Renaissance period. He is famous as a composer of songs called "frottole". He is also remembered because he murdered his wife.
We know very little about his life. He probably grew up in Mantua. In a letter he says that he came from Verona. Until around 1500 he lived and worked in Mantua, but sometimes he went to other towns when he was in trouble. In 1499 he found his wife with another man, so he murdered her. He may also have murdered the other man. We cannot be sure about this.
He does not seem to have been punished. This may be because a wealthy lady called Isabella d'Este liked him.
From 1502 Tromboncino was employed by a rich lady called Lucrezia Borgia. She is remembered today because she was a very bad woman. He wrote music for the court and for her wedding to Alfonso d'Este. Sometime before 1521 he moved to Venice, where he probably spent the rest of his life.
His frottole are very lively and full of fun. He played the trombone. This is how he got his name. He also wrote some serious sacred music.

Phobos (or Mars I) is one of Mars' moons. The other is Deimos.
Phobos is the larger of the two moons, and is only 27 kilometers in diameter. This is about as far as a car can travel on the highway in 15 minutes. It is covered with craters, as Earth's moon is.
It is named after the god Phobos in Greek mythology. It's name means "fear".
Phobos is trapped into tidal drag, and its lowering orbit roughly 1.8 meters per century. In about 50 million years, Phobos is likely to collide into Martian atmosphere, or get torn apart and form some ring systems around Mars.
The other moon, Deimos, is the smaller of the two.

The Russians have sent at least two space craft to this moon, Phobos 1 and Phobos 2. Both failed or lost contact with Earth, but Phobos 2 managed to take some pictures of the moon.

There is one large crater on Phobos called Stickney. It is formula_1 the size of the moon itself.

Japanese schools of sword making can be divided into two categories: by the provinces where they were developed and by the masters who created a specific tradition of sword making.

The late Kamakura period is often referred to as the greatest period of sword making in Japanese history. The Soshu tradition was one of the dominant traditions. Smiths like Kunitsuna and Sukezane combined their knowledge with methods from Yamashiro and Bizen traditions. Finally, a group of famous sword smiths culminated with Masamune (1264-1343 AD) and his school.

The rare swords were made out of five separate pieces and heat-treated at high temperatures. The swords of the Masamune School were harder than any of the swords made before. Masamune trained a group of at least ten followers. Two of his students (Kanemitsu and Nagayoshi) were from the Bizen province. In this way, during the early 14th century, the Masamune school attracted many smiths from other schools. Kanemitsu is believed to be the one who created the Soden School, which combined Bizen and Soshu techniques.
At the same time Chogi was developing his school. The Chogi works show a stronger influence of the Soshu tradition than Kanemitsu swords.

A table is a piece of furniture with a flat top supported by one or more legs. We put things on a table, often for a short time, for example food and knives and forks, etc. at a meal, cups for drinks, a book, a map, writing paper when writing, and things for hobbies.
We also put things on tables for a longer time, for example a TV, computer or decorations (pretty things). Often we put a cloth on the table, flat on the top. There are traditional ways of putting the cloth, knives and forks and food on the table for meals.
We can make some tables bigger, for example by pulling the top out. We can also fold some tables to transport them better, for example for camping. There are also small tables in trains and planes which we can fold or open. Some round tables come with a Lazy Susan. This is a rotating piece of wood in the center of the table.
Traditionally, tables in Japan, "chabudai", are low, sometimes round tables, for tea and food.
The name of the international organization Mensa is from the Latin word for table.

"Lark Rise to Candleford" is a 2008 British television costume drama series, adapted by the BBC from Flora Thompson's trilogy of semi-autobiographical novels about the English countryside. The first episode aired on 13 January 2008 on BBC One and BBC HD. Its cast includes actors from other late 2007 and early 2008 BBC costume dramas such as "Sense and Sensibility" and "Cranford".
The filming of a second series is expected to begin in May 2008.

The Debtors Act of 1869 abolished imprisonment for debt and the series makes much of Mrs Arless's, played by Dawn French, imprisonment for debt. In the novels the events are played out in the 1880s and later, imprisonment for debt would therefore be anachronistic.

In baseball, the Cy Young Award is an honor given to the best pitcher in the Major League Baseball. The award was first introduced in 1956 by Commissioner Ford Frick in honor of Hall of Fame pitcher Cy Young, who died in 1955. The award was given to the best pitcher in the major leagues. In 1967, the year after Frick retired as Commissioner, the practice began of honoring one pitcher in each league, the American League, and the National League.
Each league's award is voted on by two members of the Baseball Writers Association of America in each league city, meaning 28 ballots are cast for the American League winner, and 32 for the National League. Each places a vote for first, second, and third place among the pitchers of each league. The formula used to calculate the final scores is a weighted sum of the votes: Score = 5F + 3S + T, where "F" is the number of first place votes, "S" is second place votes, and "T" is third place votes. The pitcher with the highest score in each league wins the award. If two pitchers receive the same number of votes, the award is shared between the two.
The current formula started with the 1970 season. Prior to that, writers only voted for the best pitcher and used a formula of one point per vote.

A swing is a hanging seat, usually found in a playground for children. Acrobats in a circus can also have swings which hang from the top of the tent. Sometimes garden chairs are made to swing gently.
The seat of a swing is attached to a chain or a rope. The child sits on the swing and kicks off from the ground with his feet. The swing then starts to swing to and fro. The child can make the swing go higher by pulling (as he goes forwards) and pushing (as he goes backwards) the rope and by making his legs straight as it goes up.
In children's playgrounds some swings are made for very young children. They have safety bars with holes for the legs. Their parents can push them to help the swing.
Usually the ground is made of a soft material so that they do not hurt themselves too much if they fall off, although this should not happen if they are being sensible. Sometimes several swings are hung from one long metal or wooden frame.
Many children have swings in their own gardens or back yards. A tyre (or tire) can be hung by a rope from the branch of a tree to make a swing.

Task parallelism (also known as Thread level parallelism, function parallelism and control parallelism) is a form of parallel computing for multiple processors using a technique for distributing execution of processes and threads across different parallel processor nodes. It contrasts to data parallelism as another form of parallelism.
In a multiprocessor system, task parallelism is achieved when each processor executes a different thread (or process) on the same or different data. The threads may execute the same or different code. Different execution threads communicate with one another usually to pass data as they work.
As a simple example, if we are running code on a 2-processor system (CPUs "a" & "b") in a parallel computing environment and we want to do tasks "A" and "B", it is possible to tell CPU "a" to do task "A" and CPU "b" to do task 'B" simultaneously (at the same time), in order to reduce the runtime of the execution.
Task parallelism is used by multi-user and multitasking operating systems, and applications depending on processes and threads, unlike data processing applications (see data parallelism). Most real programs use a combination of Task parallelism and Data parallelism.

Heather McCartney (born Heather See on December 31, 1962 in Tucson, Arizona) is the daughter of Linda McCartney, and the stepdaughter of former Beatle Paul McCartney.
When Linda, a magazine photographer, visited England on an assignment, she brought along daughter Heather, who soon had babysitters like guitarist Eric Clapton. When Linda began a relationship with McCartney, Heather's presence was a plus, as McCartney loved children and was eager to start a family. (His engagement to actress Jane Asher had ended because she wanted to wait to have children of her own.)
Six-year-old Heather makes a brief appearance in the movie "Let it Be", visiting McCartney in the studio while the Beatles were at work. She dances around as they play, jumps out at Ringo Starr from behind a cymbal (Starr, a father himself, pretended to be scared), and sits on McCartney's lap, while he checks a microphone.
Heather gained a half-sister the next year, as mother Linda became pregnant with McCartney's baby, and the two were married. McCartney adopted Heather, who took his name, and Mary McCartney (named for Paul's own mother) was born early in 1970. Another sister, Stella, became the fashion designer Stella McCartney. A brother, James Louis McCartney, became a musician.

It sold 442,000 copies in the U.S. in the first week. It also appeared in the number one position on the "Billboard" 200 chart. According to Anthony Kiedis, "Stadium Arcadium" was going to be three different albums that the band would release; one every six months. However, they changed their mind and made one big double album. Critics said in reviews of "Stadium Arcadium" that the music on it was not very original, and was similar to the band's older work. However, they said it was still very good music. "Stadium Arcadium" won a Grammy Award, and so did "Dani California", the first single.

Gingivitis is the inflammation of the gums around the teeth. Gingivitis may be caused by a build up of plaque and tartar because the teeth have not been cleaned properly. It can also be a manifestation of a systemic disease, as in diabetes or AIDS.
Sometimes excessive brushing or flossing can wear out the gums causing gum recession.
If gingivitis is not treated by proper oral hygiene, it can lead to periodontitis, which is a more advanced state of gum disease, that affects the bone and is harder to treat.

A bar or measure is used in writing music. Each bar is a small amount of time. Most music has a regular beat (or pulse) which can be felt. Each bar usually has the same number of beats in it. Music that feels like 1-2-3-4-1-2-3-4 will be divided into bars with four beats-worth of music in each bar.
The bar line (or barline) is a vertical line which separates the bars.
At the beginning of the music there will be a time signature which shows how many beats there are in each bar.
A double bar does not mean "two bars". It means two single barlines drawn close together, one being thicker than the other. It is a "repeat sign". If there are two dots on the left of the double bar line the player should go back to where there was previously a double bar with two dots on the right, or back to the beginning of the piece.
A double barline without dots shows the end of a piece of music.
The first beat of a bar feels stronger than the others. When a conductor beats time his hand (or baton) always goes DOWN for the first beat of the bar. This feels strong. The last beat of a bar is an "upbeat" because the conductor's hand always goes up.
Barlines have been used since around 1600.

Electronic engineering is a discipline investigating all kind of situation related with electricity
and magnetism. electronic engineers are concerned with transferring of information using radio waves, the design of electronic circuits, the design of computer systems and the development of control systems such as aircraft auto-pilots.
The term electronic engineering is started to emerge in the late 1950s, the subject was known as radio engineering. Before the Second world war, Electronic engineering was commonly known as a 'radio engineering'.At this time, studying radio engineering at university considered as part of a physics degree. Later, in post war years, as consumer devices started to be developed, the field broadened to include modern TV, audio systems,
Hi-Fi and latterly computers and microprocessors. In the mid to late 1950s, the term radio engineering gradually gave way to the name electronic engineering, which then became a stand alone university degree subject.
Fundamental objects of discipline are the sciences of physics and mathematics as these help to get both qualitative and quantitative description of how such systems will work. Today most engineering work involves the use of computers and it is commonplace using computer-aided design programs when designing electronic systems.

Willows are a family of trees and shrubs which have many differences in size and type of growth, but are very much alike in other respects. There are about 350 species of this plant in all the world, usually found on moist soils in cooler zones in the Northern Hemisphere. Many hybrids are known, both naturally occurring and in cultivation, because willows are very fertile between their own species.
Some smaller species may also be known by the common names "osier" and "sallow"; the last name comes from the same word as the Latin "salix".

"For other uses of the word "bear" please see Bear (disambiguation)"
Bears are a group of large mammals. They form the family Ursidae, in the suborder Caniformia of the order Carnivora. There are 8 living bear species.

Bears usually have a big body with short and thick legs. They only have a very short tail. They have small eyes and round ears. They usually have longer, shaggy fur. On each foot they have five claws, which they cannot pull back. They have very good senses of smell and hearing. They can stand up on their back legs. Usually bears can climb and swim very well.

They are mostly active at night (except for the Polar Bear). Some bears hibernate, that means they sleep during the winter to save energy.
Bears are usually omnivorous. They eat plants and meat. They eat berries, grass and fish. An exception is the Polar Bear, which eats mostly meat.

The Fertile Crescent is a historical region in the Middle East that includes the Levant, Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt. These countries on a map together have a shape that is similar to a crescent, so archaeologist James Henry Breasted spoke of the "Fertile Crescent" because he wanted to show the similarities of the cultures of this region in ancient times.
All these lands are watered by important rivers: Nile, Jordan, Euphrates and Tigris. Together they cover some 400-500,000 square kilometers, and the region extends from the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea around the north of the Syrian Desert and through the Jazirah and Mesopotamia to the Persian Gulf. These areas are in present-day Egypt, Israel, West Bank, Gaza strip, and Lebanon and parts of Jordan, Syria, Iraq, south-eastern Turkey and south-western Iran. The population of the Nile River basin is about 70 million, the Jordan River basin about 20 million, and the Tigris and Euphrates basins about 30 million, giving the present-day Fertile Crescent a total population of around 120 million, or at least a quarter of the population of the Middle East.
The Fertile Crescent has a very long record of past human activity.

The 1920 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the VII Olympiad, were held in 1920 in Antwerp, Belgium. The 1920 Games were awarded to Antwerp to honour the suffering of the Belgian people during World War I.
The 1916 Summer Olympics, to be held in the German Empire capital Berlin had been cancelled. The results of World War I and the Versailles Peace Conference affected the Olympic Games because new states were created. The Games were also affected by sanctions against the nations that lost the war and received the blame for starting it.
Budapest was going to host the 1920 games. However, the Austro-Hungarian Empire had been an ally of Germany in the First World War. Because of this, the (now independent) Hungary lost the right to hold the games, and was not even allowed to take part. Germany, Austria, Bulgaria and Turkey were also banned from the 1920 Summer Olympics.

A total of 29 nations participated in the Antwerp Games, only one more than in 1912, as Germany, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey were not invited. From the newly-created European states, only Estonia and Czechoslovakia took part. The Yugoslavia, Brazil, Finland and Monaco competed as nations at the Olympic Games for the first time. New Zealand, which had competed as part of a combined team with Australia in 1908 and 1912, competed on its own for the first time.

Postal codes in Germany, (PLZ) (plural Postleitzahlen, have five numbers. The first two show the wide area, the three other show the postal district.
The present system was introduced on 1 July 1993. Before reunification, both the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the German Democratic Republic (DDR) used four-digit codes.
There was a temporary system after reunification. Between 1989 and 1993 postal codes in the west started with "W", eg "W-1000 Berlin 30" (postal districts in western cities were separate from the postal code) and those in the east with "O" (for "Ost"), eg: "O-1234 Berlin".
Companies that posted a lot of letters, have their own postal codes, separate from those used for postal districts or PO Box number ranges.
Postal regions do not always follow state borders. This is because sometimes it is easier to deliver mail to a place on the border from the other state.

The rest under 04931 are outside Brandenburg

Codes 21450-21499 are in Schleswig Holstein

Some codes in this range are in Thuringia.

A Unicorn is an animal from fiction. It looks like a horse or goat, with one horn on its head. The word "unicorn" comes from the Latin word "unus", which means "one", and "cornu" which means "horn".
Unicorns are in many stories from different parts of the world. Its blood and horn usually have mystical powers. Its horn (often called "alicorn" in medieval literature) has the power to heal wounds and sickness, and to neutralize poison.
In some pictures unicorns also have goat's feet or a lion's tail.

Secondary sex characteristics are features that make it easy to tell the sexes of a species apart. The features are not directly linked to reproduction.
Male birds usually have much more colorful feathers (plumage), the females are better able to hide, their feathers (plumage) stands out less.
Well-known secondary sex characteristics in humans are the deeper voice, facial hair (beard) and more muscular build in men. In women, those characteristics usually cited are more prominent breasts, wider hips, more fat, and generally a higher voice.
In men, fat deposits mainly around the abdomen, this gives them an apple shape. When women put on weight, they more resemble pears, as fat deposits mainly around the hips.

A solstice is when the Earth is the most tilted.
The June Solstice is when the Northern Hemisphere of the Earth is tilted toward the Sun and the Southern Hemisphere of the Earth is tilted away from the Sun. In the Northern Hemisphere this is called the Summer Solstice. The June Solstice is usually on June 21.
The December Solstice is when the Southern Hemisphere of the Earth is tilted toward the Sun and the Northern Hemisphere of the Earth is tilted away from the Sun. In the Northern Hemisphere this is called the Winter solstice. The December Solstice is usually on December 21.
While the exact causes were long unknown, the effect (of days getting shorter or longer) was soon recognised in many ancient cultures. Many of the pre-Christian cultures, like the druidic, the Germanic and the Norse faith therefore celebrated these events as holidays.
When the importance of the old faiths vanished, the Christian creed took over some of the festivities, which were then carried out in the honour of a new patron. The date of Christmas in the Catholic and Protestant faith is just 3 days away from the December solistice.
Today, many people still celebrate the solstices as holidays.

Marsimik La, elevation 5,582 metres (18,314 ft), is a high mountain pass in the Chang-Chemno Range in northern Kashmir. There is a road over this pass, over which suitably adapted vehicles have been driven, but it is not a motorable pass in the sense that the road is not in good enough condition to permit transit by normal vehicles.
If it were motorable, it would be the highest motorable pass in Kashmir, but reports suggest that there are probably higher motorable passes in Tibet.
Located 16 km northeast of the northwest tip of Pangong Lake, the pass is on the shortest route from there to the contested Kongka La (Pass) area 42 km further northeast on the China - Occupied Kashmir line of actual control. Marsimik La is four km west of the sharp 6000 to 6500 meter ridgeline forming the line of actual control.

The Armenian Origin of the Etruscans shows a link between the Armenians and the Etruscans.
Some scholars also see in Urartean art, architecture, language and general culture traces of kinship to the Etruscans of the Italian peninsula.
Dr. Bugge, a learned Norwegian, had made a suggestion presented a while ago by the late Dr. Robert Ellis of London, that the Etruscan was an Armenian dialect.

Etruscan words have been shown from the resources of the Armenian, the Albanian, and the Rhaeto-Romansch languages.

The Gospel of Mark is a book of the Bible. It is the second book of the New Testament and comes after the Gospel of Matthew even though it may have been written before it. The writer is believed to have been John Mark, a friend of Simon Peter, who was one of the Twelve apostles of Jesus.
The four gospels tell the story of the life of Jesus. The word "gospel" means "good news". The Gospel of Mark moves quickly, and the story shows how much Jesus worked during his short 3-year ministry. Mark's gospel tells many things about Jesus which are also found in the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke.

A frenulum (or frenum) is a small fold of tissue that prevents an organ in the body from moving too far.

There are several frenula in the body, including several in the mouth, some in the digestive tract, and some connected to the external genitalia.

Frenula of the mouth are found under the tongue and inside the upper and lower lip. These can easily be torn by blows to the face or mouth. A torn frenulum is sometimes a warning sign of physical abuse.

In the female, genital frenula can be found in the clitoris and where the labia minora meet at the back.

The word frenulum on its own is often used for the "frenulum preputii penis". This is an elastic band of tissue under the glans penis that connects to the prepuce, or foreskin to the vernal mucosa. It help contract the prepuce over the glans. It may be removed during circumcision.
It is possible for the frenulum of the penis to tear during sexual activity. This does not cause a great deal of pain but can cause an alarming amount of blood loss. This is not a medical emergency. The frenulum will heal by itself after the bleeding has stopped.

The autonomic nervous system (ANS) (or visceral nervous system) is the part of the peripheral nervous system that controls the body's internal state.
Most of these activities are performed without conscious control or sensation, but some work together with the conscious mind, such as breathing. The ANS has far reaching effects, including: heart rate, digestion, respiration rate, salivation, perspiration, diameter of the pupils, the discharge of urine, and erection.
The ANS is divided into two limbs, the parasympathetic nervous system which is primarily involved in relexation, and the sympathetic nervous system which causes the body to become more active as in the "fight or flight" response.

Alkaloids are chemical compounds that can be made naturally. They contain basic nitrogen atoms. The name comes from the word alkaline and was used to describe any alkaline containing nitrogen. Alkaloids are made by a large variety of organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals and are part of the group of natural products (also called secondary metabolites). Many alkaloids can be purified from basic substances by acid-base extraction. Many alkaloids are toxic to other organisms. Some alkaloids have a bitter taste.

The Gray Whale ("Eschrichtius robustus") is a baleen whale (a filter feeder) that has a layer of blubber up to 10 inches (25 cm) thick. It migrates from cold waters to the tropics each year in pods. Gray whales are very agile swimmers. They can dive for up to 30 minutes and go 500 feet (155 m) deep. Gray whales make grunts, clicks, and whistling sounds which may be used to communicate with other gray whales.

This giant cetacean eats small fish, crustaceans, squid, and other tiny organisms that it finds on the sea floor. It sieves its food through its comb-like plates of baleen.

Gray whales make an extraordinarily long migration from the Arctic ocean (northwest of Alaska) to the coast of Mexico, and back each year. They travel about 12,500 miles (20,110 km) each year, staying near the coast. They feed in the cold Arctic waters and calve and mate in the warm, protected tropical lagoons of the Pacific Ocean of Mexico.

A smile is a facial expression a person normally makes when they are happy. People smile for many reasons e.g. told a funny joke or smiling for a picture to be taken. However, sometimes people smile to cover up an embarrassing feeling. A smile can often be used as a sign of confidence or agreement or as a sign of happiness. Animals sometimes show their teeth -known as a snarl- to show fear or power.

On the Internet, smiles can normally be typed up. This is normally called a smiley, smiley face, or happy face. Smileys show emotion when people are not able to see it in real life. Smileys typed on the computer are called emoticons. Smileys can change depending on where the person typing the smiley is.

This is a list of some comets in the solar system.
"Periodic" comets visit us again and again. "Non-periodic" comets visit us only once. On this list there is a "P" in front of the periodic comets. In front of non-periodic comets there is a "C". There is sometimes a number in front of the "P": it shows the number of times people saw the periodic comet visiting us.

Periodic comets have a special place in astronomy, because their orbits are often the same. We know when they will visit us, and we can plan to watch them, and send space probes to look at them.
On september 11, 2004, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) standardized the way we give names to this type of comets. It made a system of letters and numbers (and sometimes a name). This system tells us which comet is which. The IAU chose the letter P for periodic comets and D for periodic comets that were lost or which broke into pieces.
Other letters are C for "non-periodic" comets, and X for comets where we do not know their orbits. It also allows for type changes by using A for objects people say are asteroids. Each name starts with a number, counting up and make the name unique: no two comets have the same name.

A right of veto means that somebody can stop decisions or legislation.
For example, the president of the United States of America has veto power over the USA's parliament. This means that he can stop laws or bills from being passed.
Similarly, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (The United States of America, the United Kingdom, China, Russia and France) each have veto power. Using this, they can stop the security council's decisions from being passed and becoming resolutions.

A Mast-Allah (usually just called a mast or must) is a kind of spiritual person in the part of the Muslim religion called Sufism. Masts sometimes seem strange or crazy to people who don't know about them, but Sufis of Iran, Pakistan, and India believe they are not really crazy but are saints.
The Indian teacher Meher Baba had one of his men, a doctor, write a book about masts called "The Wayfarers." Wayfarer means wanderer, and the book's title implied that masts are on a spiritual journey. Meher Baba wrote the introduction of the book. In his introduction Meher Baba explained that masts are traveling along an internal path and are lost because they are so dazzled (amazed) by the sights they see. They are so amazed and dazzled by these sights they see that they forget how to act normally. So Meher Baba says they are like people who are drunk, only the masts are not drunk on alcohol but on God and are very close to God.

Ventricular fibrillation (often shortened to VF or V-Fib) is a cardiac arrhythmia in which there is an uncoordinated contraction of the cardiac muscle of the ventricles in the heart. The heart is unable to pump blood around the body properly, and ventricular fibrillation can cause tachycardia and hypoxia. Ventricular fibrillation is a medical emergency. If it is allowed to continue for more than a few seconds, the blood will stop circulating, which is what causes the loss of a pulse and respiration, and the person will die.
Ventricular fibrillation is a cause of cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death. The ventricular muscle twitches randomly when it should contract in unison, and the ventricles cannot pump blood into the arteries and into the systemic circulation.

Ventricular fibrillation can often be reversed by the electric discharge of direct current from a defibrillator. If no defibrillator is available, a precordial thump can be delivered at the onset of VF to regain cardiac function, but they are not always effective. Antiarrhythmic agents such as amiodarone or lidocaine can help, but, unlike atrial fibrillation, ventricular fibrillation rarely reverses spontaneously in large adult mammals. Although a defibrillator is designed to correct the problem, it is not always successful.
In patients at high risk of ventricular fibrillation the use of an
implantable cardioverter-defibrillator has been shown to help.

Abacus is a very old tool used for arithmetic. It is still used in some parts of the world. Sometimes blind people will use an abacus, because they can feel the numbers easily. The most common abacuses work by moving beads on rods.
Abacuses can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and people can use them to find the square root of whole numbers. Expert, or very good, abacus users can sometimes do math quicker than basic calculators. There is a common chinese abacus. This abacus is splited into two basic rows, one row for the "5"s, and the bottom row for the "ones". There is one or two beads in the top row, and four or five beads in the bottom one. For example, 8 is, one on top, and 3 below, because 5 + 3 = 8. Every collumn represents a different digit.

This preview explains that Sim houses will be entirely in one large map, and states that "what you do outside your home now matters as much as what you do within". Also it is said that other Sims will age with the player's Sims as they play. It also says that the bladder and energy motives will be re-made, and replaced with "moodlets". The game will also add more aspects of real life, such as new jobs. Like "The Sims 2", there is aging. In "The Sims 3", there are seven ages. They are baby, child, teenager, young adult, adult, and old. "The Sims 3" is set 25 years before "The Sims." New things are making your own pattern for items and clothes. Players can also watch Sims go into the places where the Sim's job is.

An ice age is a period when for a long time the temperature of Earth's climate is very low. This leads to an expansion of the continental ice sheets, polar ice sheets and mountain glaciers ("glaciation").
Glaciologically, "ice age" is often used to mean a period of ice sheets in the northern and southern hemispheres; by this definition we are still in an ice age (because the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets still exist). More colloquially, when speaking of the last few million years, "ice age" is used to refer to colder periods with extensive ice sheets over the North American and Eurasian continents: in this sense, the last ice age ended about 10,000 years ago. To be precise one should use the term "glacial periods" for colder periods during ice ages and interglacial for the warmer periods.
Many glacial periods have occurred during the last few million years, initially at 40,000-year frequency but more recently at 100,000-year frequencies. These are the best studied. There have been four major ice ages in the further past.

Ammit was the Egyptian idea of the punishment of the soul. Ammit was believed to eat any souls found to have sin. They would them be digested for eternity in acid. Or, Ammit who was believed to be the guardian of a lake of fire, would place the soul into the liquid fire for all eternity.
Ammit was a mix of the crocodile, lion, and hippo. Some of the most feared animals in Egypt at the time.
Rather than being worshiped Ammit was feared, she was not viewed as a god. Although she was viewed as a good force because she destroyed the evil.
Although Ammit is seen as a devouring entity, she is neutral and strictly serves at the whim of the other deities to take souls that have sinned against the gods and consign them into oblivion.

The Bundestag is the legislature of Germany. It meets in Berlin, in the Reichstag building, which was specially rebuilt ready for the Bundestag to move from Bonn
The Bundestag has at least 598 members. Every 4 years the German people vote.
Each party gets seats, if they got at least 5% of the votes. Every voter has two votes, one for a person and one for a party. 299 members represent a constituency, just like in the British House of Commons or the US House of Representatives.
The other half are elected from a party list in each Land. The total number of seats a party gets depends on the number of the second "party votes" it gets.
But if a party is wins more constituency seats then its share of the party votes then it keeps those seats but extra Land-list seats are created, to keep the percentage of seats correct. The extra seats, or "extra mandates" are the reason the Bundestag sometimes has more than 598 members.

Biological warfare (or germ warfare) is when pathogens are used as a weapon. This is called a biological weapon. Pathogens are organisms that can cause disease. If non-living things (like toxins) are used, this is considered to be chemical warfare.
During the Second Sino-Japanese War, biological weapons were used by the Japanese army against China. The Japanese army usually launched contaminated fleas or food from planes.
Today, pathogens for diseases like anthrax or smallpox could be used as agents for biological weapons.
The production, and stockpiling of such weapons was forbidden in the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972

The Coachella Valley is a desert valley in the Colorado Desert of Southern California. It is famous as a resort destination and an agricultural region.
Many people visit the area and enjoy the pleasant weather during tourist season, which is from September to June. Winter in the Coachella Valley is very pleasant, much like spring in other parts of the country. Summer is very hot and dry, with temperatures over 100 degrees Fahrenheit/40 degrees Centigrade. Although the area is a desert, there are lots of water both under the ground and in aqueducts from the Colorado River. The weather is so similar to weather in the Middle East that the area grows more than 95% of the nation's crop of dates. A grapefruit called the "Coachella Grapefruit" was first grown there.
One of the world's greatest engineering feats is in Palm Springs. The Palm Springs Aerial Tramway brings visitors from the floor of the valley to the top of Mount San Jacinto, 8516 feet (3000 metres) up!

The Toba catastrophe theory is a scientific theory that the volcano Toba (on Sumatra) erupted. The eruption happened between 75.000 and 70.000 years ago. According to the theory, the average temperature dropped between 3-3.5 degrees Kelvin. This caused most of the humans living at that time to die. According to the theory, only 10.000 (perhaps only 1.000) pairs of humans survived the disaster. Perhaps it led to the other hominids becoming extinct. After this, the Earth was colonised again, starting from Africa.

Giro d'Italia
The Giro d'Italia, or Tour of Italy, is a famous bicycle race held in Italy, every spring. It is one of the most famous, and best paid bicycle races. The first race was in 1909. It started because the editor of a newspaper called "La Gazzetta dello Sport" wanted more people to read his newspaper. He planned a race similar to the Tour de France, which had started in 1903.
The leader of the race wears a pink jersey (called the "maglia rosa". This is because pink is the colour of "La Gazzetta dello Sport". The leader of the mountain climbing competition wears a green jersey (called the "maglia verde"), and the leader of the sprinters' competition wears a mauve jersey (called the "maglia ciclamino"). The leader of the young rider's competition wears a white jersey (called the "maglia bianca"). This is the same as the young riders' competition in the Tour de France.

An infectious disease is a disease or sickness that happens when an organism (a living thing such as a plant or animal) is attacked by a pathogen. Pathogens (such as bacteria, viruses, and other germs) are too small to see. Some infectious diseases are contagious, which means that the sick plant, animal, or person can get other things sick. The pathogen can get from one organism to another through air, food, water, blood, or physical touch.
Usually, the sick organism heals. Then, the organism's body learns how to fight the pathogen. If the pathogen attacks again, the immune system knows how to fight it. Thanks to the immune system, people usually can't get the same disease twice. When an organism's body knows how to fight a disease, the body is immune to that pathogen.
Infectious disease is a large cause of pain and death. The World Health Organization says that infectious diseases cause about 25% of all deaths. These three pathogens cause the most deaths: HIV (the virus that causes AIDS), Tuberculosis, and Malaria.

The Acts of the Apostles (Greek "Praxeis Apostolon") is a book of the Bible, which now is the fifth in the New Testament. It is often simply called Acts.
Acts tells the story of the Early Christian church, with particular interest for the ministry of the Twelve Apostles and of Paul of Tarsus. The early chapters, play in Jerusalem, report Jesus's Resurrection, his Ascension, the Day of Pentecost, and the start of the Twelve Apostles' ministry. The later chapters report Paul's conversion, his ministry, and finally his arrest and imprisonment and trip to Rome.
Most people think that the author of Acts also wrote the Gospel of Luke. The traditional view is that both the two books were written "c." 60 by a companion of Paul named Luke. Many theologians still think so. But some modern scholars think the books were written by an unknown author at a later date, sometime between 80 and 150.

Cast iron is an alloy of iron. The term is usually used for grey cast iron. There are two main types of cast iron: "grey cast iron" and "white cast iron". The differences between the two are mainly based on the amount of silicon in the alloy. All cast iron has about 95% iron in it. Grey cast iron has 2% silicon and 3% carbon. White cast iron has less silicon.
The silicon in grey cast iron causes the carbon to change into graphite. This causes it to have a dark grey or almost black color. With less silicon, the carbon in white cast iron changes to cementite or "iron carbide" (Fe3C). This causes white fractures to form on the surface and give white cast iron the name.
Grey cast iron is very good at conducting heat. Because of this, it is often used to make cookware.

A Runestone or Rune stone is a large stone, with runes inscribed on it, dating from the early Middle Ages. Currently, about 6000 such stones are known to exist in Scandinavia. About half of them date from the tenth and eleventh century, and were found in Sweden. Most of them are like grave stones. They announce the life and death of a local person. About 10 percent of the known stones tell about the travels and deaths of persons abroad. Some of these texts are similar to what Scandinavians who travelled to Byzantium have written in Latin.

Evangelism is the Christian practice of preaching the truth of Jesus Christ to both Christians and non-Christians. The purpose of most "evangelism" is to help others receive eternal (forever) Salvation to people who have not heard of, or have denied God. "Evangelism" is done in obedience to the Great Commission, a command from Jesus to his disciples to convert others, as recorded in the New Testament. Christians who are good at "evangelism" are known as evangelists, whether in their areas or to far away places. Some Christian traditions consider "evangelists" to be in a leadership position, and they may be found preaching to large meetings.

The Revolutions in the German states developed in most of the 38 states of Germany that were loosely bound together in the German Confederation after the Congress of Vienna in 1815. To these states belonged Austria as well though Hungary that was part of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire was not part of the German Confederation.
These revolutions had as example the French revolution in February 1848, when King Phillipe of France abdicated the throne.
The most successful events of the German revolutions happened in March in Berlin and Vienna, when the fight of the citizens was successful. The result was the election of an German National Assembbly in Frankfurt am Main.
But it was in Berlin too where the Prussian king Frederick William refused to become emporor of a united German state.
Austria and Prussia withdrew their delegates from the Assembly, and the Assembly itself slowly disintegrated afterwards.

Mount Edziza, located 38 km southeast of Telegraph Creek, British Columbia, Canada, is a potentially active volcanic complex in the Stikine Volcanic Belt. It is a shield volcano that began erupting about 10 million years ago with continued activity until about 1,340 years ago.
It is made up of a lot of cinder cones and blocky lava flows that still keep their first forms. This is the second biggest area of volcanic activity in the northern Stikine Volcanic Belt as well as in Canada. The complex includes the Mount Edziza Plateau, a big volcanic plateau (65 kilometers long and 20 kilometers wide) made of mostly basaltic lava flows with four big stratovolcanoes built on top of the plateau.
A lot of eruptions have happened in the last 10,000 years including: Desolation, Mess Lake, Snowshoe lava fields, Kana Cone, Eve Cone, Cinder Cliff, Icefall Cone, Ridge Cone, Williams Cone, and Walkout Creek. Many of the volcanic features in the volcanic complex are protected as part of Mount Edziza Provincal Park one of the bigger provincial parks in British Columbia.

The Goths (Gothic:, "Gutans") were an East Germanic tribe. Jordanes is a scholar from the 6th century. He wrote a summary of a twelve volume work by Cassiodorus about the Goths. Jordanes work is commonly called Getica. As the original work by Cassiodorius was lost, Getica is the only surviving contemporary account about the Goths. According to this work, they left Scandinavia and settled close to the mouth of the Vistula river (in present day Poland). In the 3rd and 4th centuries they settled Scythia, Dacia and parts of Moesia and Asia Minor. In the 3rd and 4th centuries, they fought with the Roman Empire and later adopted Arianism (a form of Christianity). In the 5th and 6th centuries, they split into the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths. With this move, they established powerful successor-states of the Roman Empire in Italy and on the Iberian peninsula (now Spain & Portugal).

A stalagmite is a form that can be found on the floor of a cave. It rises from the floor of a limestone cave when mineralized solutions drip from the ceiling and deposits of calcium carbonate form columns on the ground. The corresponding formation on the ceiling of a cave is known as a stalactite.
When touring caves with stalactites and stalagmites you might be asked to not touch the rock formations. This is generally because the formation is considered to still be growing and forming. Since the rock buildup is formed by minerals solidifying out of the water solution, skin oils can disturb where the mineral water will cling. So the development of the rock formation will be affected and not natural anymore.
Stalactites and stalagmites can also form on concrete ceilings and floors, but they form much more rapidly there than in the natural cave environment.

A Power network is a type of contact network where its members can tell other people what to do.
It must be large enough to literally scare or force people to go along with its requests, which makes them orders or commands. This typically requires thousands of people in constant touch with each other.
A political party is the most obvious example. It is typically much larger than a social network but is not one, since people can only call on each other for a small number of reasons, and perhaps at specific times. Also not every member of the network has the same role or right to help.
A corporation may also be a power network if it relies on many power relations to maintain itself - for instance, the right to draw oil from the ground or dump waste without being held responsible for it.
When a power network achieves some stable grasp of political power and daily working control of some critical infrastructural capital, it becomes a power structure. In a democracy the visible power networks represented by the parties compete regularly in an election - but much of the power structure, typically the bureaucracy, does not change, and is typically ignored as a power network in itself.

The Hudson Motor Car Company was an American automobile manufacturer, founded in Detroit, Michigan in 1909. They were well-known for producing low-priced cars of good quality. They also pioneered safety features in their cars, like dashboard warning lights for oil pressure and generator power. Hudson's production peak was in 1929, with 300,000 cars built in their factories in America, Belgium and England.
In 1954, Hudson merged with the Nash-Kelvinator Company, to form American Motors Corporation. American Motors (also known as AMC) became famous for their line of Jeep vehicles (a civilian version of military Jeeps), and later Ramblers, Gremlins, and Pacer cars. AMC was finally bought out by the Chrysler Corporation, which still makes Jeep brand vehicles.

Jack Kerouac's novel "On the Road" describes road trips made by Kerouac and his friend Neal Cassady, driving a 1949 Hudson automobile. (Cassady ruined his car, driving cross-country at speeds over 100 miles per hour, without giving the car the maintenance it needed.)

Carisbrooke Castle is the Isle of Wight's only remaining medieval castle. It was built on a Roman site. The castle earthworks were begun in 1070.
The shell keep was built on the site some 70 years later. None of the Norman domestic buildings now remain. The gatehouse with its drum towers dates from the 14th and 15th centuries.
In 1377 the French landed on the island but the castle was not attacked.
During Elizabethan times the threat of a Spanish invasion was avoided when the Spanish Armada was turned away at a nearby battle. However, the castle was considerably altered to resist the new artillery. Outer lines of defence were built enclosing the old castle. The curtain walls, bastions, and bulwarks remain in good condition to this day.
Charles I was held prisoner at the castle in 1647. An attempt to escape failed when he got stuck in the bars.
Later the castle was the occasional residence of the governor of the Isle of Wight and it became home to Princess Beatrice, youngest daughter of Queen Victoria, when she was governor.

"Full House" is an American comedy television series. It originally aired from 1987 to 1995. It told the story of Danny Tanner (Bob Saget), a man whose wife has died and is left alone with his three daughters, DJ (Candace Cameron), Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin), and Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen). He recruits his best friend, Joey Gladstone (Dave Coulier), a child-like stand-up comedian, and his brother-in-law (and the girls' uncle) Jesse Katsopolis (John Stamos), a struggling musican, to move in and help look after the girls.
The series is often criticised for its sickly sweet and unrealistic plotline and corny jokes, even though it ran for many years; some episodes dealt with real problems such as child abuse, drinking, and lying. Yet it has remained, in recent years, one of the very few adult comedy series that parents can watch with their kids.

A symbol is a drawing, shape, or object that represents an idea, object, or amount of something.
The most common symbols are letters, which are symbols of words and sounds. A symbol can be an actual object, such as the crucifix (a symbol of Christianity) and the scepter (which symbolizes royalty and power). Symbols can even be colors or patterns. Symbols are used often in poetry and other types of literature, most often used as metaphors or similes.
A national emblem is a symbol for a certain country.

There are thousands of symbols that are recognized by most people all over the world, and many more that are limited to certain regions, religions, sciences, etc.. Some of the best known ones are listed below.

The Inca Empire was the largest empire in pre-Columbian America, and was large even by world standards. The administrative, political and military center of the empire was located in Cuzco. The Inca Empire began in the highlands of Peru around 1197. From 1438 to 1533, the Incas used conquest and peaceful assimilation to gain a large portion of western South America, that centered on the Andean mountain ranges, and included large parts of modern Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, and Chile.
In 1533, Atahualpa, the last Inca sovereign emperor (Qhapaq Inka, also "Sapa Inca"), was executed by the conquistador Francisco Pizarro. That meant the beginning of Spanish rule in South America. The Inca Empire was supported by an economy based on the collective ownership of the land.

Baltic countries are three countries in Northern Europe at the eastern side of the Baltic Sea and at the southern side of Gulf of Finland. Baltic countries are Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Lithuanian and Latvian people speak Baltic languages and Estonian people speak Finnic language.
By their culture and history Baltic countries are close to Nordic countries. The biggest difference in the history was that Baltic countries were occupied by Soviet Union while Nordic countries (with the exception of Karelia, a part of Finland) were not occupied. Baltic countries had their freedom back when the Soviet Union came to an end. Today the Baltic countries are some of the richest and most advanced of those countries that were part of Soviet Union.
Paganism was the religion of Baltic people before most of them took Christianity long, long ago. Baltic paganism never died out and some people are still pagans.

Vithoba is a Hindu god worshipped mainly in the Indian states of Maharashtra and Karnataka. He is also known as Vitthala and Panduranga. He is generally considered a form of the Hindu god Vishnu or Krishna. In stone images and pictures, he is shown as a dark young boy. He stands on a brick with his hands on his waist. His wife Rukmini or Rakhumai stands with him.
Vithoba's main temple is at Pandharpur in Maharashtra. It is close to it's border with Karnataka. Two Hindu sects, the Varkari sect of Maharashtra and Haridasa sect of Karnataka worship Vithoba as their main god. The Varkari poet-saints have written devotional poems called "abhanga"s in praise of god Vithoba. The abhangas are written in the language Marathi. The Haridasa poets have also written poems, devoted to Vithoba in the Kannada language. The two most important festivals associated with Vithoba are "Shayani Ekadashi" in the Hindu month of Ashadha, and "Prabodini Ekadashi" in the Hindu month of Kartik.

The poem is three parts long - the three parts are "Inferno" (Hell), "Purgatorio" (Purgatory), and "Paradiso" (Paradise, or Heaven). "Inferno" is the most famous section of the poem. The poem is about the travels of a man through Christian hell (place for bad people in Christianity), purgatory (place for people who have been bad but not bad enough to go to hell), and heaven (place for people who lived by the rules of Christianity). Note that comedy does not mean funny, yet more like not ending with a bad thing.

Raster graphics (or bitmap graphics) is one of two ways to do computer graphics. With raster graphics, images are modeled as a big collections of pixels. Usually they form a rectangle. Each pixel has special things, like color, or transparency. Raster images are used very often. Computer screens are made of a raster of points. That way, vector graphic images need to be rasterised. Images that are difficult to make as a vector, like photographs are often in the form of a raster image.
Many printers today use languages like Postscript or PCL. These languages are based on vectorized images, most of the time. To be printed, these images must first be translated into raster graphics. This is done by a component called Raster Image Processor. Most modern printers have raster image processors in the printer. Some printer use a special piece of software on the computer to do the rasterising.

A calculator is a machine which allows people to do math operations more easily. For example, a normal calculator will add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
Some also do square roots, and more complex calculators can help with calculus and draw function graphs. Calculators are found everywhere. Even our computer is a calculator.
Some calculators, like the abacus will work without batteries, others, like the electronic calculator won't. There are two types of electronic calculators, the simple one, with only the main functions of plus, minus, times and division, and sometimes a square root, and the scientific one, with many other functions too such as factorials, and permutations.
There are different ways to write mathematics on a calculator. For example, after pressing "3" and then "+" and then "2" and then "=" (or "ENTER") the number "5" will be displayed on the screen. This is called Infix notation. Many more advanced calculators use postfix notation, that is, "3 4 +" instead of "3 + 4 ="; The third way of noting things, "+ 3 4", called prefix notation, is rarely found on calculators.

Poetry is a type of art form and a type of literature.
Poetry uses the qualities of words, in different ways, to be artistic.
(Poetry can be as short, as a few words, or as long as a book (an epic)).
There are many "poetic forms" (forms of poetry).
Some of them are: Sonnet, Haiku, Ballad, Stev, Ode, Free verse, Blank verse, thematic, and nursery rhymes.
Poetry can be used to describe(comparing, talking about, or expressing emotion) many things. It can make sense or be nonsense, it can rhyme or not. It can have many shapes and sizes; it can be serious, or it can be funny.
"To say something poetically" means to give information in an artistic way.

Rishi is a word used in many Hindu scriptures. A simple translation of the word into English would mean a sage. Hindu scriptures and Hindu mythology tell about a number of rishis. They describe a rishi as an old person, with a lot of knowledge and wisdom. They also say that some of the rishis had great powers, and sometimes even some gods of Hindus like Indra were afraid of rishis. Some of the rishis were famous for becoming angry very quickly and easily. Their anger sometimes resulted in the rishis cursing people.
Rishis used to live in deep forests. Many young men from villages and towns also lived with them as their students and disciples. Rishis taught them in schools called Gurukuls. After education, these young men returned to live with their families. However, some of them shall always remain with the rishis as their disciples. Sometimes, even kings and other members of the ruling families would go to them to seek advice and blessings. Sometimes these rishis and their disciples would go to the royal courts and participate in discussions there.
Seven such rishis were the most famous. Hindu scriptures have named them as "saptarishis", that is, the seven sages. The seven sages were Kashyapa, Atri, Vashitha, Vishvamitra, Gautam, Jamdagni, and Bharadvaja. According to Hindu mythology, these seven sages had become like divine beings. Ancient astrology of Hindus identified these seven sages with the stars of the sky, the Great Bear. Their wives formed the Pleiades.

These members are called "Companions". Male companions are called "Knight Companions". Female members are called "Lady Companions". There are also a number of extra members known as "Supernumerary" Knights and Ladies. These members are usually members of the British Royal family and monarchs of other countries. Unlike other British Orders, the Sovereign is the only person who decides who is chosen to be a member of the Order of the Garter.

Honolulu, Hawaii
Honolulu is the capital city of the U.S. state of Hawaii. It is also the largest city in Hawaii and it has the most important harbor. It is on the south-east shore of the island of Oahu.
Honolulu means "sheltered harbor" in the Hawaiian language. No one knows for sure when Honolulu was first settled or when the name was first used.
Honolulu harbor was called Kulolia before foreigners came. The first foreigner was Captain William Brown of the English ship Butterworth, in 1794. He named the harbor Fair Haven. Other foreign captains started calling it Brown's Harbor. The name Honolulu was used some time after that.
Honolulu quickly became the most important harbor of Hawaii. At that time, sandalwood was a big export. Honolulu was also an important supply point for whalers.
Kamehameha III made Honolulu the capital city of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1850. It was also the capital of the Republic of Hawaii and the Territory of Hawaii. It stayed the capital when Hawaii became a state in 1959.

The 2002 Atlantic hurricane season was a yearly event of tropical cyclones forming in the Atlantic Ocean. The season officially began on June 1 and ended on November 30. In total, 12 named storms and 4 hurricanes formed.
Because of an El Nino event happening in the Pacific Ocean, the season ended early on October 16 when the last storm died out. Although most of the season remained quiet, it was very active during the month of September and broke the record of the most number of storms forming in September. The most notable hurricanes were Hurricane Lili which was the storngest and deadliest storm of the season, and Hurricane Isidore which killed a total of 7 people in Louisiana.

Tropical Depression Seven formed from a tropical wave on September 7. It had a maximum wind speed of 35 mph and a minimum pressure of 1013 mbar. It moved usually west, and was later torn apart by wind shear on September 8. It did not have an effect on land.

Tropical Depression 14 formed from a tropical wave on October 14. It had maximum wind spedds of 35 mph, and a minimum pressure of 1002 mbar. For most of the time, it was predicted to become a tropical storm, and to go up through the Bahamas. However, strong wind shear from the northeast didn't allow development, and after making landfall in southern Cuba on October 16, it was destroyed by a cold front. Although it created heavy rains, there was no damage.

Anorexia nervosa is a mental health condition and an eating disorder. The short name for this condition is anorexia. People with anorexia think that they are fat, or desperately fear becoming overweight or fat. They try to lose weight by eating too little and doing too much exercise. They do not eat the amount of food their body needs, in an effort to avoid gaining weight. This causes them to stay at a weight that is not normal for their age and height.

Doctors use the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders to make a diagnosis and decide if a person has anorexia or not. Four signs of anorexia are listed in the manual. People do not have to show all four signs for the doctor to decide that they have anorexia.

An analog or analogue signal is any continuous signal.
The difference from a digital signal is that also very small fluctuations in the signal are meaningful. When one speaks of analog one often means an electrical context, however mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic, and other systems may also convey analog signals.
An analog signal uses some property of the medium to convey the signal's information.
Any information may be conveyed by an analog signal, often such a signal is a measured change in physical phenomena, such as sound, light, temperature, position, or pressure.
For example, in sound recording, fluctuations in air pressure (that is to say, sound) strike the diaphragm of a microphone which causes corresponding fluctuations in a voltage or the current in an electric circuit. The voltage or the current is said to be an "analog" of the sound.

In Australian Aborigine religion, the Dreamtime, also called The Dreaming, had four parts: The beginning of everything; the life and power of the ancestors; the way of life and death; and power in life. Dreamtime was all four of these things at the same time because it is more powerful than time and space. In it all things exist at once. The aborigines call Dreamtime the all-at-once time because they think it is the past, present, and future at the same time.
They meet The Dreamtime by doing special dances and singing special songs. The aborigines believe that people have a part of them that will live forever. This part existed before a person was born and will exist after they die. It exists in The Dreamtime. All Australian Aborigines believe in the Dreamtime. Each tribe has stories that say things about it. Most Aborigines believe that all life is connected to the great spirit ancestors of the Dreamtime.
The expression Dreamtime is often used to describe the time before time, or the time of the creation.

Albinism is a condition some people and animals are born with. This condition is caused by a lack of pigment (color) in their hair, eyes, and skin. A person or animal with albinism is sometimes called an albino, but many people prefer to be called a "person with albinism".
People with albinism usually have white or light blonde hair and very fair skin. Their eyes are blue, or rarely pink-ish. People with albinism in reality do have some problems including bad vision and getting sunburn easily. All of these problems are because people with alibinism have little or no pigments in their eyes, skin and hair.
Vision problems in albinism include nystagmus (irregular fast movements of the eyes), strabismus (where the eyes fail to balance) and refractory errors (like being "near-sighted" or "far-sighted").
Albino animals are easily attacked by predators because they cannot hide themselves like the non-albino members of their species.

Albinism is a hereditary condition. It is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern; it means, both parents should carry the albinism gene to have a child with albinism.

, born Louis Laurent Marie Clerc, (December 26, 1785 in France - July 18, 1869) co-founded the first school for the deaf (people who cannot hear) in the United States.
Deaf people in America respected Clerc and call him the "Father of the Deaf" because he founded the first school for the deaf in America in Hartford, Connecticut. Clerc and Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet founded that school on April 15, 1817 in an old hotel. The school moved to its present location in 1821 and is now named The American School for the Deaf. The American School for the Deaf is the oldest school for the deaf in the United States.

The Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) is a Micronesian island nation in the western Pacific Ocean. The capital of Marshall Islands is Majuro.
Roughly 10% of the population of the Marshall Islands can now be found in northwest Arkansas, U.S. Most live and work in the city of Springdale, a community of roughly 50,000. Each year, the Marshallese host a homecoming event so friends and relatives can get together to celebrate, stay in touch with politics at home, and spread their island culture. They meet at the Jones Center for Families in Springdale and have dancing, feasting, volleyball, and basketball. As a population, they are devoted to family and church and bring island dance and song to this corner of Arkansas.

Mustelids are a family of carnivorous mammals. They are the family "Mustelidae", in the order "Carnivora".
They are among the largest and oldest families, and contain a large diversity of animals, from weasels who eat mice to wolverines that can crush a reindeer. Mustelids can live in many places, otters for example, live mostly in the water, while one species of weasel lives in the arctic.
One kind of mustelid, the ferret, has been tamed and used for hunting for a long time. These days it is mostly kept as a pet, though. Because the ferret looks a bit like a rat that has been stretched out in the middle, it is sometimes called a tube rat.

The following are other well-known animals from the mustelid family.

The name insectivora (insect eater) has reference to the food habits of the group as a whole. Although moles and shrews are not all strictly insectivorous, insects and other small animal life constitute the chief dietary items of most members of the group. Some kinds, the otter shrews of Africa and the star-nosed mole of America, for example, feed also upon fish. The Townsend mole of the Pacific Northwest often is a nuisance to bulb growers because of its fondness for the bulbs of many kinds of plants.
Moles, as a group, are subterranean in habit and spend most of their lives in the darkness of underground tunnels which they usually excavate for themselves. Correlated with this fossorial habit, the eyes of all moles are very small, in some species actually not opening to the outside, and of little value to them. On the other hand, their senses of touch and smell are highly developed.

One species of mole and four species of shrews occur in Texas.

Global Positioning System, also known as GPS, is a system of satellites in space which are circling the Earth.
It is one of three different satellite systems to help people find out where they are. This system sends and receives microwave signals to a receiver on Earth (called a GPS receiver) and tells the person holding the receiver where they are on Earth, whether they are moving or not (like traveling in a ship or auto), how fast they are moving, and what direction they are going.
The system has more than 24 satellites circling the Earth, all of them working together to tell people where they are.
The system was created by the Department of Defense of the United States (U.S.). In the beginning, it was only used by the U.S. military, but in 1983 President Ronald Reagan made an order to allow anyone to use the system.
GPS is commonly used in cars, cell phones, and GPS receivers.

A potato is a kind of vegetable, or the vegetable that grows this fruit. It contains a lot of starch and other carbohydrates
The potato plant grows well in many different parts of the world. It is a small plant with large leaves. The part of the potato that people eat grows under the ground. It usually has a brown or pink skin and is white or yellow inside.
The potato is not very good to eat unless it is cooked. People cook potatoes by boiling, roasting, or frying them. French fries or "chips" are potatoes cut into long pieces and fried until they are soft. Potato chips or potato crisps are potatoes cut into very thin round pieces and fried until they are hard.
The potato was first grown and eaten in the Andes Mountains of South America. When the Europeans came to South America, they brought the potato back to Europe.
The scientific name of the potato plant is "Solanum tuberosum".

The coat of arms of Germany (German Wappen Deutschlands) is a symbol of Germany; the coat of arms feature an eagle. The coat of arms are similar to those of the flag of Germany (black, red and gold). It is the oldest extisting state symbol in Europe and is one of the oldest insignia in the world. Its history as an emblem is far longer, however. To the Germanic tribes the eagle was the bird of the god Odin, and by the Romans, too, it was revered as the symbol of the supreme god, of the emperor and of invincibility. From there and through its religious significance in Christendom it came to be incorporated into medieval symbolism.

The Narwhal ("Monodon monoceros") is a rarely seen Arctic whale. This social whale is known for the very long tooth that males have. Very little is known about this whale. Narwhal meaning "corpse whale" in Old Norse.

All narwhals have two teeth in their upper jaw. After the first year of a male narwhal's life, its left tooth grows outward, spirally. This long, single tooth projects from its upper jaw and can grow to be 7-10 feet (2-3 m) long. Tusks are usually twisted in a counterclockwise direction and have a hollow interior. The tusk's function is uncertain, perhaps used as a formidable jousting weapon in courtship and dominance rivalry, in obtaining food, and/or for channeling and amplifying sonar pulses (which they emit). The tusk is not used in hunting. Long ago, narwhal sightings reinforced (or started) the unicorn legends.

Narwhals live in the icy waters of the Arctic seas. They rarely stray far from ice. In summer they infrequently enter estuaries, deep fjords, and bays.

The Liver birds are two large and famous bronze metal birds on top of a building - the Liver Building - in the city of Liverpool, England. The building has the offices of an insurance organization. The birds are symbol of the city, although no birds really look like this.
The sound of the end of the word "liver" in the name of the bird is like "driver" not "river". The start of the word Liverpool ("liver") sounds like the word "river". This is a funny play on words.
There is also a British television sitcom with the same name that is about two women in Liverpool. The play on words is increased by a second British slang meaning of the word "bird" to mean a young woman.
Many people in Liverpool (they are known as "Liverpudlians") are proud of their city and of the Liver birds. There is a story that the birds will come alive if a truly pure woman walks between them. This will never happen! This is an example of the humor of the local people.

Maoism is the communist (a plan about how countries should work) idea created by the Chinese man Mao Zedong. Mao believed that peasants, not factory workers, should lead the communist revolution (change in government). China followed Maoism when he became leader, in 1949. This created differences with communism in the USSR and Cuba. Maoism is still practiced in China today, but it has become different since Mao died in 1976. Today the Chinese economy is considered a capitalist (a plan about free markets).

"Secret Water" is the eighth book in Arthur Ransome's Swallows and Amazons series of children's books. It was published in 1939.
This book is set in and around Hamford Water in Essex, close to the resort town of Walton-on-the-Naze. It brings the Swallows and the Amazons together and introduces a new group of characters, the Eels and the Mastodon. Ransome sailed to Hamford Water, an area of salt marshes and low lying islands in his boat "Nancy Blackett". He set the book in this tidal place which offered a new setting for his characters and chances to explore and map the area.

The Swallows mean to sail in the "Goblin" to Hamford Water and camp with their father, but he is called away on naval business. Instead he maroons them with a small boat (dinghy) on an island. Before he leaves, Father gives them a basic map of the area they call Secret Water and suggests they map the area before he returns to pick them up.
For a surprise, he has arranged for the Amazons to come down from the Lake District and join them with another dinghy.
They see some mysterious footprints which turn out to belong to the Mastodon, a local boy. He mistakes them for the Eels, another family who camp in the area regularly. Later the Eels arrive and are initially hostile before they settle down for a friendly war.
It seems that due to the distractions of war and being cut off by the tides, the chart will not be completed. However early in the last morning two separate groups of children complete it.

The GNU Image Manipulation Program, or GIMP or "The GIMP", is a free software picture maker.
It is often used for making logos, making photographs bigger or smaller, changing colours, making many pictures part of one picture, making pictures nicer to look at, and changing file formats.
GIMP is often used as a free software rival for the most popular Adobe Photoshop, but it is made to be an Adobe Photoshop. The GIMPs mascot is a coyote named Wilber.
The GIMP was started in 1995 by Spencer Kimball and Peter Mattis and is now taken care of by a group of volunteers as part of the GNU Project. The newest version of GIMP is v.2.6.4 and it was available since January 2009. The GIMPs license is the GNU General Public License, GIMP is free software.

GIMP can be used for opening and changing many types of file formats. GIMPs own file format is XCF, which is the name of the building where GIMP was written.
Some file formats that GIMP can be used with are bitmap, JPEG, PNG, GIF and TIFF. GIMP can also read and write path information from SVG files and GIMP can read Adobe PDF files and the raw image formats used by digital cameras, but cannot write to these formats.

The Second Epistle to the Corinthians is one of the books in the New Testament. It is an epistle (letter) written to the Church at Corinth by the Apostle Paul.

Paul begins by greeting the people in Corinth and reminding them that he is serving the Lord Jesus Christ. He then spends a lot of time explaining to the people why he is an apostle. Some of the people are mad at him because in 1st Corinthians he told them to stop doing bad things. He explains that he told them to stop because he loved them. He also teaches them that it is very important to forgive others.

An igloo (or iglu) is a shelter (a place for people to stay warm and dry) made from blocks of snow placed on top of each other, often in the shape of a dome (like half of a hollow ball). They were used in winter as temporary shelters by hunters when they were away from their regular homes.
They were most often built in places where a lot of snow covers the land for weeks or months at a time, such as the far north of Canada and Greenland. Most igloos are built by native Inuit people (sometimes called "Eskimoes"). As they learned to build them better, sometimes people would build larger igloos that would last longer and hold more people, even for dancing.

Monasteries are places where monks live. Although the word "monastery" is sometimes used for a place where nuns live, where nuns live is usually called a convent or nunnery. The word abbey (from the Syriac word "abba": "father") is also used for a Christian monastery or convent. The monk in charge of an abbey is called an abbot, the nun in charge of an abbey is an abbess.
There are several religions which have a system of monasteries. Christian monasteries have a chapel for the monks to worship. Monks are not allowed to marry (this is called "celibacy"). They are also not allowed to own anything. All the things they use, including their clothes, belong to the monastery. During the Dark Ages after the Roman Empire was defeated, monasteries were some of the few places where knowledge still existed.
Some monasteries were built in places far away from where other people lived. The monks who live there live very isolated lives, growing their own food and looking after one another. Other monasteries were in or near towns. The monks do a lot of work in the community, such as teaching, medical care or telling people about God. There are not many monks who live isolated lives nowadays. Monks have a tradition that they suecide after 20 years, so these monasteries have been used by tons of people.

A parliamentary system of government means that the executive branch of government must have the direct or indirect support of the parliament. This support is usually shown by a vote of confidence. The relationship between the executive and the legislature in a parliamentary system is called responsible government.
The separation of powers between the executive and law making branches, is not as obvious as it is in a presidential system, so there are different ways of balancing powers between the three branches which govern the country (the executive (or ministers), the law makers and the judges).
Parliamentary systems usually have a "head of government" and a "head of state". The head of government is the prime minister, and the head of state often being an elected (either popularly or through parliament) president or hereditary monarch.

In computer science, runtime or run time describes the operation of a computer program, the duration of its execution, from beginning to termination.
The term runtime can also refer to a virtual machine to manage a program written in a computer language while it is running.
Run time is sometimes used to mean runtime library, a library of basic code that is used by a particular compiler but when used in this fashion, runtime library is more accurate.
A runtime environment is a virtual machine state which provides software services for processes or programs while a computer is running.
Runtime activities include loading and linking of the classes needed to execute a program, optional machine code generation and dynamic optimization of the program, and actual program execution.
For example, a program written in Java calls for services from the Java Runtime Environment by issuing commands from which the expected result is returned by the Java Runtime. By providing these services, the Java Runtime Environment is considered the runtime environment of the program. Both the program and the Java Runtime Environment request services from the operating system. The operating system kernel provides services for itself and all processes and software running under its control. The Operating System may be considered as providing a runtime environment for itself.

Leo III (died June 12, 816) was Pope from 795 to 816. He is famous for the coronation of Charlemagne as emperor in 800.
Leo reported his election to Charlemagne, sent him the keys of Saint Peter's tomb and the banner of Rome. Charlemagne replied that it was his function to defend the church and the Pope's to pray for the kingdom and for victory of the army.
Charlemagne went to Rome in November 800, and on December 1 held a council there with representatives of both sides. Leo, on December 23, took an oath of purgation concerning the charges brought against him, and his opponents were exiled. Two days later Leo crowned Charlemagne at St. Peter's tomb. Charlemagne did intervene in church affairs, not always successfully.
The reasons for the coronation, the involvement beforehand of the Frankish court, and the relationship to the Byzantine Empire are all matters of debate among historians.

A laugh is a way of showing happiness. It is a noise that a person makes when he hears something funny, like a joke, or is tickled.
Sometimes people laugh when they are not happy. When people are ashamed or embarrassed, sometimes they react by laughing.
There are different ways to laugh. A person can laugh using mostly their voice, mostly their throat, or mostly their nose.
You can write a laugh in different ways. Some people write "ha ha ha", or "he he he", or "heh". If they are on the internet, they also use "LOL". "LOL" doesn't sound like a laugh, but it stands for Laughing Out Loud.
Laughter can be observed in human infants from around three or four months and is usually an expression of surprise. It often elicits a positive response in adults who will involuntarily mimic the child. Video footage on the youtube site of babies laughing were shown to HM The Queen Elizabeth during her visit to the google headquarters on 16 October 2008 where both she and her husband the Duke of Edinburgh were reduced to 'fits of giggles'.

A superpower is a country that is one of the most powerful countries in the world. It is more powerful than a major power.
In the years following World War II, the United Nations was formed. The 5 countries that had nuclear bombs - those who were able to start a nuclear war - were all given "permanent" seats on the Security Council. This means they are on the Security Council forever. They were also all given equal veto power over decisions in the Security Council. These five countries were: United States, United Kingdom, China, France, and the Soviet Union.
After the Soviet Union split into a lot of smaller countries in 1991, Russia got most of their nuclear weapons, and also their permanent seat in the Security Council. Some other countries have also got nuclear weapons now, and can also start a nuclear war just as well, but they are not permanent members with veto power.

Akkad (Sumerian: Agade, Bible: Accad) was an ancient city found in Mesopotamia. The ruins have never been found yet, but it is believed to be on the Euphrates river between Sippar and Kish. The area was called "Uri-ki" or "Ki-uri" in Sumerian.
According to the Sumerian king list, Akkad (Agade) was built by Sargon of Akkad. Even so, it is known from older cuneiform writings that the city was already there before Sargon, in the time of the kings of Uruk, Enshakushanna and Lugal-Zaggesi. According to the Bible (Genesis 10:10), it was one of the cities started by Nimrod. Also, in the early Sumerian legend called "Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta", the countries where the languages were scattered are said to be: Shubar (Subartu), Hamazi, the Mar.tu (Amorites) land, Sumer, and Uri-Ki (Akkad), again showing the place is very old. Also, in the earliest records, when Mesopotamian kings started calling themselves "lord of the four quarters" around Sumer, these were listed as: Martu, Shubar, Elam, and Uri-ki.
As the capital city of the Akkadian Empire beginning with Sargon, the city ruled from around 2300 to 2215 BC, when it was destroyed by the Gutians who invaded from the mountains. The Akkadian language was one of the Semitic languages, and at the time of the Akkadian Empire it was made official in both Mesopotamia and Elam.
Later to reclaim the land General Paynis Ahkhad invaded, and claimed the land under the people of Tell-Ahkm

A consulate is a small official office of a country in another. The main office is called an Embassy, and is in the capital city. Consulates are in other large towns and usually do not do all of the jobs of the embassy.
Consulates usually deal with questions about passports for their own citizens, visas for foreigners wanting to visit the consulate's home country and licences for import and export.
Some larger and more important countries might also have Consulates General. These are simply bigger consulates which might do more than a smaller consulate.
People who work in any sort of consulates are called consular officers. The person in charge is called a consul, or consul general. An honorary consul does not work full time for the government. They are usually in port towns, to speed up issuing documents for trade. An honorary consul might be a citizen of the country he works for, or have another link such as parents or grandparents or they may have married someone from there. They usually work in an office, use their office as the honorary consulate.
Consular officers have diplomatic immunity.

Chromosomes are parts of a cell that have genetic information. Each chromosome contains many genes. Chromosomes come in pairs: one from the mother; the other from the father. Scientists have labelled chromosomes with numbers.
Chromosomes are in all cells. These cells go through different phases, and when they get too big, they divide. When a stomatic cell (eg muscle cells) divides it is called mitosis. The sex cells or gametes go through a different reproductive process called meiosis. Before mitosis, the cell copies all the chromosomes and then it can divide. When they duplicate, chromosomes look like the letter "X". When they are separated they look like a big stringy mess. They are called chromatin when they are separated. This X is called a double helix.
There are 46 chromosomes in a human, and one pair of sex chromosomes. Different animals have different amounts of chromosomes. Everyone has a chromosome from their father, and a matching chromosome from their mother. If a person does not have the exact number of chromosomes, they could die or have one or more peculiarities. For example, they could get a genetic disorder like Down syndrome (which is when there is an extra chromosome 21) and Klinefelter's syndrome (a male with two X chromosomes). Some genetic disorders are more common than others.

A character is a person in a work of art such as a novel, play, opera or movie. If it is a made-up person (not someone who really lived) it is a "fictional character". Some examples are Kermit the Frog, Yoda, and Bart Simpson of "The Simpsons.
The word character can also mean "personality". We can say that someone has a "strong character" meaning a strong, confident personality. It is sometimes used as a noun in this sense: "He is a real character" (meaning someone you cannot easily forget).
A character role in a play means one of the people in the play who have a particular character (personality). They contrast with the main characters of the play. For example, there may be two lovers who are the main characters of the story. The character roles might be: a wicked step-mother, a kind nurse, an old wise man, a stupid fool, a servant who is very old etc.

The fire triangle is used to show the rule that a fire needs three things to burn. These things are heat, fuel, and oxygen. If one of these three is removed, the fire will be put out.
Without heat, a fire cannot begin. If a fire becomes cool enough, it will not keep burning. Heat can be removed by using water. This only works on some types of fire. Separating burning fuels from each other can also reduce the heat. In forest fires, burning logs are separated and placed into safe areas where there is no other fuel. Turning off the electricity in an electrical fire removes the heat source, but other fuels may have caught fire. They will continue burning until the firefighters deal with them and their fire triangles. Without oxygen, a fire cannot can not start. Oxygen may be removed from a fire by covering it in some way. Some foams and heavy gases (for example, carbon dioxide are often used for this. The fire can also be closed off away from a source of oxygen. Once all the oxygen in the closed off area is used by the fire, it will go out if it cannot get more oxygen.

Widescreen is a video format often used in movies. It is also becoming very popular for television and other things like Computer monitors.
Widescreen is often used as it let more of an image to be seen on the screen.
Widescreen is often used as a nickname for the 16:9 aspect ratio of television screens. This means that if the television screen was sixteen inches wide it would have to be nine inches tall. A "regular" television's screen would be 4:3 which means if it was four inches wide it would have to be three inches tall. In adition to these small screens, a screen could be any size with the same ratio. For example, a screen could be 32 inches wide and 18 inches tall and still be considered widescreen.

The Oneroi (Greek: "dreams") were the sons of Hypnos, the god of sleep in Greek mythology. They were the personification of dreams. They were Morpheus, Phobetor (or Ikelos) and Phantasos.
They lived in caves in the far west, near the gates of the Underworld. They were sent through one of two gates there. One gate was made of horn, from there the true or prophetic dreams come from. The other gate was made of ivory, from there the false and meaningless dreams come from.

The most powerful of the Oneiroi was Morpheus. His brothers Phobetor and Phantasos shape parts of dreams, while Morpheus shapes the dream in general. Morpheus shapes human figures, Phobetor shapes animal figures and Phantasos shapes inanimate objects.

A gas chamber is an airtight room used for killing people or animals by means of gas. The gas used is either poisonous, or it causes asphyxiation. The people or animals are put into the gas chamber, the door is sealed airtight from the outside, and a gas, such as carbon monoxide or hydrogen cyanide, is put into the chamber. The victims die from choking (asphyxiation) from being made to breathe the poisonous gas.
The gas chamber was invented in Nevada, United States in 1929, as the government of Nevada did not want to use an electric chair and considered hanging to be cruel and inhumane. The gas chambers became notoriously infamous in the Nazi Germany as they were first used in the "T-4" programme (killing disabled people) and then in the Holocaust for mass murdering of Jews, Gypsies and other people that the Nazis did not like.
The United States Supreme Court decided that the gas chamber is a cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the constitution in 1999. Death from hydrogen cyanide poisoning can take up to fifteen minutes. It is extremely painful and terrifying. The witnesses and reporters who had seen people getting executed in the gas chamber said that death in the gas chamber is sheer torture. It is no longer used in any of those states which still have the death penalty.

Adenine is a chemical component of DNA and RNA.
It forms several tautomers, compounds that can be rapidly interconverted and are often considered equivalent.

In DNA, adenine binds to thymine via two hydrogen bonds to assist in stabilizing the nucleic acid structures. In RNA, which is used in the cytoplasm for protein synthesis, adenine binds to uracil.

In older literature, adenine was sometimes called Vitamin B4. It is no longer considered a true vitamin nor part of the Vitamin B complex. However, two B vitamins, niacin and riboflavin, bind with adenine to form the essential cofactors NAD and FAD respectively.
Some think that, at the origin of life on Earth, the first adenine was formed by the polymerization of five hydrogen cyanide (HCN) molecules. However, this has been criticized by some chemists.

Skinks are different from other lizards. They have very small legs and necks. Some have no legs at all; these move more like snakes than lizards. Their tails can grow back when part of it is cut off. This is called "regeneration".
Most skinks can only grow to be 12cm long. Some can grow to be 35cm.

Many skinks are carnivorous, which means they eat meat. Some types of skinks eat both plants and meat, making them omnivores, or things that eat both plants and meat.

A physical law, scientific law, or a law of nature is a scientific generalization based on empirical observations of physical behavior. Empirical laws are typically conclusions based on repeated scientific experiments over many years, and which have become accepted universally within the scientific community. The production of a summary description of nature in the form of such laws is a fundamental aim of science.
Laws of nature are distinct from the law, either religious or civil, and should not be confused with the concept of natural law.
Nor should 'physical law' be confused with 'law of physics' - the term 'physical law' usually covers laws in other sciences (e.g. biology) as well.

Some extremely important laws are simply definitions. For example, the central law of mechanics "F" = "dp"/"dt" (Newton's second "law" of mechanics) is often treated as a mathematical definition of force. Although the concept of force predates Newton's law, there was no mathematical definition of force before Newton. The principle of least action (or principle of stationary action), Schroedinger equation, Heisenberg uncertainty principle, causality and a few other laws also fall into this category (of mathematical definitions).

Web colors are colors used in designing webpages, and the ways for describing and listing those colors.
There are several ways to chose colors for parts of webpages. Colors may be listed as an RGB "triplet" (a set of three numbers) in hexadecimal format (a "hex triplet"). Many common colors can also be chosen by their common English names. Often a color tool or other graphics software is used to create color values.
The first versions of Mosaic and Netscape Navigator used the X11 color names as the base for their color lists. This was because they both started as X Window System applications.
Each web color has its own definition, sRGB. This relates to the chromaticities of a single phosphor set, a given transfer curve, adaptive whitepoint, and viewing conditions. These have been chosen to be similar to many real-world monitors and viewing conditions. Even without color management, the colors created are fairly close to the given values. However, user agents can be different in the fidelity with which they show the colors. Better user agents use color management to create better color fidelity. This is important for Web-to-print applications.
Original HTML web colors (formulated in the late 1980s).
Gold and orange were added to the original 16 shown above shortly after their introduction.

The Roman Catholic Church is the largest group of Christians, with over 1 billion people. It says that it continues the original Christian group, started by Jesus Christ and his followers, about 2,000 years ago.
The word Roman derives from its headquarters in Vatican City, which is located within the city of Rome, Italy. The word catholic comes from the Greek word "katholicos", which means "universal." Although many Christian groups call themselves "catholic", the phrase "the Catholic Church" usually means "the Roman Catholic Church". Typically, people who call themselves 'Catholic' mean that they are a member of the Roman Catholic Church. It also means that they follow the teachings of the Church.
People in the Roman Catholic Church are found all over the world, but many Catholics live in Western Europe, Southern Europe, Ireland, United Kingdom, Sub-Saharan Africa, India, South Korea, the Philippines, Oceania, Latin America and the United States. The Roman Catholic Church is led by the pope, who lives in the Vatican City. According to Catholics, the pope is infallible in religious matters. This means that his official statements ('ex cathedra') are true and must be obeyed. The first pope is the apostle Peter, according to the Catholic Church, because some parts of the bible which hint that Peter will start the church (Matthew 18, "thou art Peter ('rock'), and upon this rock I will build my church"). Right now the pope is Benedict XVI.

In Botany, an annual plant is a plant that usually germinates, flowers and dies in one year. True annuals will only live longer than a year if they are prevented from setting seed. Some seedless plants can also be considered annuals even though they do not flower.
In gardening, annual often refers to a plant grown outdoors in the spring and summer and surviving just for one growing season.
Many food plants are, or are grown as, annuals, including most domesticated grains. Some perennials and biennials are grown in gardens as annuals for convenience, particularly if they are not considered cold hardy for the local climate. Carrot, celery and parsley are true biennials that are usually grown as annual crops for their edible roots, petioles and leaves, respectively. Tomato, sweet potato and bell pepper are tender perennials usually grown as annuals.
Ornamental annuals are often called bedding plants. Annuals are often used in gardens to provide splashes of color, as they tend to have a longer season of bloom than hardy herbaceous perennials.
Examples of true annuals include corn, lettuce, pea, cauliflower, watermelon, bean, zinnia and marigold.

Summer annuals sprout, flower and die within the same spring/summer/fall. The lawn weed, crabgrass, is a summer annual

Willie Brown (August 6, 1900 - December 30, 1952) was an American guitarist and singer. He played with Charley Patton, Son House, and Robert Johnson

Brown was born in Clarksdale, Mississippi.

He was known to be shy and only wanting to accompany other musicians rather than play lead guitar. Robert Johnson called him "my friend boy Willie Brown".
Brown is heard playing on the Paramount label sessions of 1930. He played "M & O Blues" and "Future Blues". He also played songs with Son House and Charlie Patton. There are also rumours that he played with Luke Thomson and Thomas "Clubfoot" Coles. At least four other songs he recorded for Paramount have never been found.
Brown also played a song during the Great Depression for the Library of Congress called "Make Me a Pallet on the Floor".

A song called "Rowdy blues" was thought to have Brown playing on rhythm guitar since he played another song ("Future Blues") on the same album ("Son House & The Great Delta Blues Singers").

He died in Tunica, Mississippi at the age of 52.

Beccles is a small market town in Suffolk, England, around the area of The Broads. The town had a population of about 9,850 people around 2005. Beccles has a suburb called Worlingham which has a combined population of about 13,580. Beccles is twinned with Petit-Couronne in France.

Baccles was once a flourishing Saxon riverport, but today it is in the Waveney valley thet is a popular boating centre. The town was granted its Charter in 1584 by Queen Elizabeth I.
The Peck family was associated with Beccles for a long time. The Puritan Peck was eventually forced to leave to Hingham, Massachusetts, founded by many members of his parish, where he resided for several years, until King Charles I had been executed and Oliver Cromwell was in charge of government. At that time, Robert Peck decided to return to Hingham, Norfolk, and continued his pastorship of St. Andrews Church. He died in Hingham but he left descendants in America, as well as his brother Joseph Peck, who settled in Rehoboth, Massachusetts.

Guildford (; IPA) is the county town of Surrey, England. It is the county seat for the borough of Guildford and the administrative headquarters of the South East England region. It is located about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of London on the A3 trunk road. About 66.000 people live there.

Its location is due to the gap in the North Downs where the River Wey is forded by the Harrow Way. The town became important enough by 978 to be the Royal Mint. With the building of the Wey Navigation and Basingstoke Canal Guildford was in the centre of a network of waterways that aided its prosperity.
The Guildford pub bombing in 1974 killed five people including four off-duty soldiers from the local barracks. The subsequently arrested suspects became known as the Guildford Four.

The hominids are members of the biological family Hominidae (the great apes), which includes humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. "Great ape" is a common name rather than a taxonomic label and there are differences in usage. Subtly, it may seem to exclude human beings ("humans and the great apes") or to include them ("humans and non-human great apes"). "Homo sapiens" is not at any especial remove from other members of the biological family, and humans are therefore described here as great apes.
This constitued, the Hominidae includes 4 genera and 5 species. Its nonhuman members are restricted to equatorial Africa, Sumatra and Borneo. Hominid fossils date the Miocene and are known from Asia.
Hominids range in weight from 48 kg to 270 kg. Males are larger than femals. Hominids are the primates, with robust bodies and well-developed forearms. Their pollex and hallux are opposa except in humans, who have lost opposability of the big toe. All digits have flattened nails. No hominid has a tail, and none has ischial callosties. Numerous skeletal differences between hominids and other primates are related to their upright or semi-upright stance.
The classification also includes the ancestors of the currently living species.

Cork is a material that is harvested for commercial use primarily from the bark of the Cork Oak tree.
Portugal produces 50% of cork worldwide.
Cork's elasticity together with its near-impermeability makes it suitable as a material for bottle stoppers, especially for wine bottles. Cork stoppers represent about 60% of all cork based production. Cork's low density makes it a suitable material for fishing floats and buoys, as well as handles for fishing rods (as an alternative to neoprene). Cork is also used in the manufacture of musical instruments, particularly woodwind instruments, where it is used to fasten together different segments of the instrument and make the seams airtight.
The cork industry is generally regarded as environmentally friendly. The sustainability of its production and the easy recycling of cork products and by-products are two of its most distinctive aspects.
Cork demand has increased due to a larger proportion of wine being sealed with cork rather than being sold in bulk. Top quality corks are quite expensive, so many cheaper brands have switched to lower quality cork, synthetic plastic stoppers, screwcaps, or other closures.

Termites are a group of social insects. They are sometimes incorrectly called "white ants". Usually they are classified at the taxonomic rank of order Isoptera. As truly social animals, they are termed "eusocial" along with the ants and some bees and wasps. Termites mostly feed on dead plant material, mostly wood, leaf litter, soil, or animal dung. About 10% of the estimated 4,000 species (about 2,600 taxonomically known) are economically significant as pests that can cause serious structural damage to buildings, crops or plantation forests. Termites are major detrivores, particularly in the subtropical and tropical regions. Their recycling of wood and other plant matter is very important for ecology.
As eusocial insects, termites live in colonies that, at maturity, number from several hundred to several million individuals. They are a prime example of decentralised, self-organised systems using swarm intelligence and use this cooperation to exploit food sources and environments that could not be available to any single insect acting alone. A typical colony contains nymphs (semi-mature young), workers, soldiers, and reproductive individuals of both genders, sometimes containing several egg-laying queens.

Biogas means a gas produced by the anaerobic digestion or fermentation of organic matter in an environment without oxygen. The organic matter can be manure, sewage sludge, municipal solid waste, biodegradable waste or any other biodegradable feedstock. Biogas is mainly methane and carbon dioxide.
Biogas can be used as a vehicle fuel or for generating electricity. It can also be burned directly for cooking, heating, lighting, process heat and absorption refrigeration.

Biogas production by anaerobic digestion is popular for treating biodegradable waste because valuable fuel can be produced while destroying disease-causing pathogens and reducing the volume of disposed waste products. The methane in biogas burns more cleanly than coal, and produces more energy with less emissions of carbon dioxide. The harvesting of biogas is an important role of waste management because methane is a greenhouse gas with a greater global warming potential than carbon dioxide. The carbon in biogas was generally recently extracted from the atmosphere by photosynthetic plants, so releasing it back into the atmosphere adds less total atmospheric carbon than the burning of fossil fuels.

The composition of biogas varies depending upon the origin of the anaerobic digestion process. Landfill gas typically has methane concentrations around 50%. Advanced waste treatment technologies can produce biogas with 55-75%CH4.

Stonehaven ("Steenhive" in the Doric dialect of Scots) and "Cala na Creige" in Gaelic is a town with around fourteen thousand inhabitants (9,577 in the 2001 census) on the northeast coast of Scotland. It is the county town of the historic county of Kincardineshire or The Mearns and the present day county of Aberdeenshire. It grew around an Iron Age fishing village, now the "Auld Toon" ("old town"), and expanded inland from the Seaside. As late as the 16th century, old maps indicate the town was called Stonehyve or Stonehive.

Stonehaven was the birthplace of Robert William Thomson, inventor of the pneumatic tyre and the fountain pen, of journalist James Murdoch and Lord Reith of Stonehaven, first Director-General of the BBC.
Stonehaven was a holiday retreat of the poet, Robert Burns.
The novelist Lewis Grassic Gibbon (James Leslie Mitchell) attended school at what was the old Mackie Academy (now Arduthie Primary). Mackie Academy now serves over 1000 pupils and they study his work.
Famous historical visitors include William Wallace and Mary Queen of Scots.

Capybara ("Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris") is a semi-aquatic rodent of South America. It weighs about a hundred pounds, and is about 2 feet tall at the shoulder.

The world's largest rodent (related to rats and mice). They weigh in at around 55 kg. The capybara's stocky body has a length of about a metre and a height at the shoulder around 60 cm. It ranges in colour from brown to reddish and has tough skin, which is sometimes used to make high quality leather. The eyes and ears are high on the head so they can easily be kept above water when swimming.

The capybara is semi-aquatic, living in grassy wetland areas or close to rivers. It carries out most of its activities on land, using water as a refuge where is swims and dives with ease. There are simple webs between the toes that help when swimming. They can hold their breath under water for only a few minutes, but can hide in water when necessary for much longer, with only their noses sticking out of the water. The hottest hours of the day are spent in the water and grazing is done in the mornings, evenings and at night.

Ammunition, often called ammo, comes from the French word "la munition". At first it meant all items used for war. This was from the Latin word "munire" (to provide). It now is used only for gunpowder and artillery. The group word for all types of ammunition is munitions. This means anything that can be used in combat and includes bombs, missiles, warheads, and mines (landmines, naval mines, and claymore mines). These are made in munitions factories.
Ammunition is mainly used to send out force against a target. Ammunition can also include flares and incendaries - chemicals that start fires. Since the making of the cartridge, ammunition has come to mean the putting of a projectile - the item that is sent to hit the target, and its propellant - the chemical that creates the force, into a single package.
Ammmunition is a complex subject. It covers use of fire to a hit target, use of weapons by people, explosives and propellants, cartridges, high explosive projectiles (HE), warheads, special shells to attack armour and aircraft, carrier projectiles, fuses, mortar ammunition, small arms (revolver and pistol) ammunition, grenades, mines, flares, improved conventional munitions, and computer guided munition.

Doom is a violent first-person shooter computer game made by iD software in 1993. It is one of the first games to use 3 dimensional levels. The game is about killing demons and zombies. Doom has traps that will hurt you and sometimes make you die and fall to the ground. Doom was also the first game with multiplayer deathmatch. This means you can fight with other players instead of the demons and zombies. The game was made with a computer language called C using some new techniques John Carmack created.
It has two sequels: Doom 2 that came out in 1994, and Doom 3 that came out in 2004.

War communism is the name for the economic policies that Vladimir Lenin introduced in Russia. Lenin was the leader of the Bolshevik political party. It was introduced in 1918, and he got rid of it in 1921 because it was not successful. He introduced New Economic Policies in 1921 instead.
It was bad for the Russian economy. This is because they took away extra grain produced by the workers. This was known as grain requisitioning. Workers were not allowed to sell their extra food. So workers didn't produce much food any more, because there was no point because no food could be given out any more because no extra was produced, Russia ended up with lots of people who did not have any food.

The ear is the part of the body that lets people hear. People and most vertebrate animals have two ears.
Some animals do not hear through ears. Spiders have small hairs on their legs that they can hear with.
Some animals have large ears. The rabbit has large ears so it can hear very well, which are used to listen for predators.
The ear works by funneling sound to the inner ear. These vibrations are sent to the brain by a network of nerves.
Some types of elephant use their large ears to cool themselves in the heat of their homeland.

Charles-Valentin Alkan (born Paris 30 Nov 1813; died Paris 29 March 1888) was a French composer and pianist. His real name was Morhange. He was a virtuoso pianist who wrote a lot of piano music which is mostly extremely difficult to play. Although people like Franz Liszt and Busoni thought he was a great composer, it is only in recent years that most people have realized how good his music is. His piano music is mostly tonal, but it changes key in unusual ways. The story was told by many people that he died when a bookcase collapsed on top of him, but that story is proved not to be true.

The Clovis culture was the first widely spread Indian culture in the Americas. The Clovis people lived in the Americas about 13,000 years ago. They lived there for between 200 and 800 years. Different sources list different lengths of time in that range.
They had a special way of making tools like spear tips and knives made from stones. Artifacts that they made made in this way can be found in many places in North America. The Clovis way of making tools only lasted between 500 and 1000 years. After that, other ways became more popular.
They are called "Clovis culture" because archaeologists first found their artifacts at a place called Clovis, New Mexico.

An inclined plane is a simple machine. It allows one to use less force to move an object.
Examples of inclined planes are ramps, sloping roads and hills, plows, chisels, hatchets, air hammers, carpenter's planes, and wedges. The typical example of an inclined plane is a sloped surface; for example a roadway to bridge a height difference.
Another simple machine based on the inclined plane is the blade, in which two inclined planes placed back to back allow the two parts of the cut object to move apart using less force than would be needed to pull them apart in opposite directions.

There have been many religious debates over "Harry Potter" because of the witchcraft in it. Some religious groups think the Harry Potter books go against their god because they represent witchcraft or are Satanic (meaning anti-God).
In the United States, people tried to get the books banned in schools. Their argument was that witchcraft is a registered religion, so letting the books in schools went against the separation of church and state. This was then brought up in court as being against the Freedom of Religion.
Many people have said that the books do not resemble real witchcraft. They say that the witchcraft in Harry Potter is the same as in "The Chronicles of Narnia" and "The Lord of the Rings", which are often thought of as Christian books.

A choice is the act of making a decision. Making a choice is making a resolution to do something or act a certain way. We all make choices everyday. From what we are going to have for breakfast to whether we drive or walk to work.
The field of economics examines how people make choices about how to use scarce resources and goods, such as their money or free time. Some ways of thinking such as existentialism argue that people's choices and decisions are very important.

Some people believe that every person and animal in has a right to free choice. However some criminals have to have some of their free choice and will removed, when they are put in jail, because they have committed a crime or hurt people.

A vortex mixer is small machine used in laboratories to mix small beakers of liquids.
What's inside?
Inside, a vortex mixer has an electric motor which turns a pipe facing upwards. This pipe is attached to a small rubber bowl where one can put a beaker of liquid to be mixed up. The rubber bowl turns quickly and creates a vortex or a spiral flow inside any liquid which is placed on it and is therefore mixed up. Most vortex mixers have controls which let the user control how fast or slow they want the mixer to turn and can also set it to turn continuously for a certain length of time.

Vortex mixers are used in bioscience laboratories to mix two different chemicals for a desired effect or to dilute an acid or an alkali by mixing them with water.

Decapitation or beheading is the act of cutting off the head from the rest of the body of a living thing. "Beheading" usually means that the removal of the head is intentional. It is generally done during a murder or execution with an axe, sword, or guillotine. If the removal of the head is an accident or unintentional, it is called "decapitation". It can happen because of an auto accident, explosion, factory accident, a mistake during a hanging or some other violent accident.
Decapitation is always fatal, that is, the result is always death.
Decapitation can also describe the removal of a head from a body that is already dead. In these situations, the head is usually a trophy or a public display of warning.

A songwriter is a writer who creates songs. A songwriter generally writes pop songs, rather than art songs or classical music. Many songwriters are also singers, and perform the songs they write. Other songwriters have their songs performed by other singers.

The history of writing songs is thousands of years old. Scholars believe that men and women may have created and sung songs even at the time of prehistory. Many modern bands have one or two members who write songs for the band. Others have more members contribute songs, or give the whole band credit for writing. Others perform songs by outside writers.

Dipole can mean two things in physics. The first is an "electric dipole" which separates the positive charge from the negative charge. A simple example of this dipole is a pair of electric charges with the same magnitude but with the opposite type of charge (positive and negative) and are separated by a small distance from each other. The second is a "magnetic dipole", a closed circulation of electric current. A simple example is a single loop of wire with electric current flowing through it.
An important characeristic of dipoles is their dipole moment, which is a vector quantity with both a magnitude and direction. An example of an electric dipole moment occurring is in a pair of electric charges with opposite signs. The dipole moment would point from the negative charge towards the positive charge. The magnitude of the moment is equal to the strength of each charge multiplied by the distance separating between the charges. An example of a magnetic dipole moment occurring is in a wire loop with flowing current. The magnetic dipole moment would point through the loop (according to the right hand rule), with a magnitude equal to the current in the loop times the area of the loop.
A bar magnet is an example of a magnetic dipole, with a magnetic dipole moment moving from its south pole to its north pole.

Candidiasis, often called yeast infection or thrush, is a type of infectious disease. It is a fungal infection (mycosis). The disease is cause by any of the "Candida" species of yeast. "Candida albicans" is the most common species.

Candidiasis is a very common cause of vaginal irritation, or vaginitis. It can also occur on the penis or scrotum. In unhealthy patients, the "Candida" infection can affect the esophagus. It could become systemic. This would cause a much more serious health condition, a fungemia called candidemia.

The Malacostraca (Greek: "soft shell") are the largest subgroup of crustaceans. They include decapods (such as crabs, lobsters and shrimp), stomatopods (mantis shrimp) and krill. There are 22,000 members in this group. It represents two thirds of all crustacean species. The first malacostracans appeared in the Cambrian period.
The classification of crustaceans is currently being debated. Some think Malacostraca is a class and others think it is a subclass.

Malacostraca have heads with six segments. They have a pair of antennules and a pair of antennae. They also have mouthparts. There are appendages near the mouthparts, called maxillipeds. They have five pairs of walking legs. The first pair is formed like a pincer. There are eight thoracic segments. There are six abdominal segments. They are used for swimming. Members of Malacostraca have compound stalked or sessile eyes. They have a two-chambered stomach and a centralized nervous system.

Burial is the act of placing an object or human into the ground. The burial of objects can also be called interment. The burial of dead humans can also be called inhumation.
Human bodies are usually buried in a cemetery. It is common practice in many places to put bodies into a coffin and place the coffin into a grave. The grave is then usually marked with a headstone so that people know who is there and can visit them.
In the past, often during times of war, many bodies have been placed into the same grave without coffins. This is called a "mass burial" or a "mass grave".

Storks are a family of birds ("Ciconiidae"). They usually live near shallow bodies of water where they wade through the water, and catch small animals, like frogs, crabs, or small fish. Many species of stork are migratory, they spend the summer and the winter in different places. There are 19 different species of stork, in 6 genera.
Probably the best known stork is the White Stork. It is known to build large nests in high places, like on chimneys. Stork nests are often very large. They may be used for many years. Beforehand, people believed storks were monogamous, that they only had one partner in life. More recent research has shown though, that they may change partners. They are attached to a nest almost as much as to a partner.
The Marabou Stork, which lives in Africa, has a wingspan of up to 320 cm. This makes it the largest bird still alive, together with the Andean Condor.

A microscope is a scientific instrument that makes things normally too small to see look bigger, so they can be seen better and examined correctly. People who use microscopes commonly in their jobs include doctors and scientists.
The earliest microscopes had only 1 lens and are called "simple microscopes". "Compound microscopes" have at least 2 lenses.
In a compound microscope, the lens closer to the eye is called the "eyepiece". The lens at the other end is called the "objective".
Microscopes make things seem larger than they are, from 10 times larger to about 1000 times larger. This is much stronger than a magnifying glass.

Shivan Qaderi (or Sivan Ghaderi or Schuaneh Ghaderi; born 1979 or 1980; died 9 July 2005 in Mahabad) was a student and opposition activist in Iran. After his death in 2005, the Kurds protested and the Iranian government had to send more than 100,000 soldiers to this region. The Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran reported, that about 50,000 people had protested after his death on the Chuwarchira Square. Humans Rights First say that, after he was shot, Iranian soldiers tied Ghaderi's body "to a military vehicle and dragged it through the city, obviously trying to frighten the population so that they would not organize any more protests."

June 6, 1944, also known as D-Day, stands for the biggest amphibious (from the sea to the land) attack in military history, known as "Operation Overlord". D-Day took place during World War II on the beach of Normandy. The Allies (British and American) attacked Nazi-German occupied Europe. It was very important for the Allied success in World War II. Though many men were lost when the beaches were taken over. After that, about two months later, after very hard fighting and many killed, the Allies won. They freed France from the Germans.
Many people think D-Day stands for Decision Day, but it does not, the first letter is just to show the importance of the day.
June 6th is very important to many Americans, British, and Canadians because of what happened.
Often, the day something big happens, when a decision that can't be changed is made, it is called "D-Day".
